one of fords greatest challenges was dealing with the continued vietnam war american offensive operations against north vietnam had ended with the paris peace accords signed on january the accords declared a cease fire across both north and south vietnam and required the release of american prisoners of war the agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of vietnam and like the geneva conference of called for national elections in the north and south the paris peace accords stipulated a sixtyday period for the total withdrawal of us forces
the accords had been negotiated by united states national security advisor kissinger and north vietnamese politburo member l c th south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu was not involved in the final negotiations and publicly criticized the proposed agreement however antiwar pressures within the united states forced nixon and kissinger to pressure thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of american forces in multiple letters to the south vietnamese president nixon had promised that the united states would defend thieus government should the north vietnamese violate the accords
in december months after ford took office north vietnamese forces invaded the province of phuoc long general trn vn tr sought to gauge any south vietnamese or american response to the invasion as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion
as north vietnamese forces advanced ford requested congress approve a million aid package for south vietnam funds that had been promised by the nixon administration congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin senator jacob k javits offered large sums for evacuation but not one nickel for military aid president thieu resigned on april publicly blaming the lack of support from the united states for the fall of his country two days later on april ford gave a speech at tulane university in that speech he announced that the vietnam war was over as far as america is concerned the announcement was met with thunderous applause
 us citizens and vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the south vietnamese capital of saigon during operation frequent wind in that operation military and air america helicopters took evacuees to us navy ships offshore during an approximately hour period on april to immediately preceding the fall of saigon during the operation so many south vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people other helicopters having nowhere to land were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers close to the ships their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats

north vietnams victory over the south led to a considerable shift in the political winds in asia and ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of us influence there the administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions once when khmer rouge forces seized an american ship in international waters and again when american military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone dmz between north and south korea
the first crisis was the mayaguez incident in may shortly after the fall of saigon and the khmer rouge conquest of cambodia cambodians seized the american merchant ship mayaguez in international waters ford dispatched marines to rescue the crew but the marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as unknown to the us the mayaguez sailors were being released in the operation two military transport helicopters carrying the marines for the assault operation were shot down and us servicemen were killed and wounded while approximately khmer rouge soldiers were killed despite the american losses the operation was seen as a success in the united states and ford enjoyed an point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath the americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial wall in washington dc
some historians have argued that the ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a soviet plot but work by andrew gawthorpe published in based on an analysis of the administrations internal discussions shows that fords national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local and perhaps even accidental provocation by an immature khmer government nevertheless they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other communist countries in asia
the second crisis known as the axe murder incident occurred at panmunjom a village which stands in the dmz between the two koreas at the time this was the only part of the dmz where forces from the north and the south came into contact with each other encouraged by us difficulties in vietnam north korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the us to withdraw from south korea then in august north korean forces killed two us officers and injured south korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in panmunjoms joint security area the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of nonaligned nations in colombo sri lanka at which kim jongil the son of north korean leader kim ilsung presented the incident as an example of american aggression helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a us withdrawal from the south
