sometime in my sixteenth year i decided i wanted to be in public life as an elected official i loved music and thought i could be very good but i knew i would never be john coltrane or stan getz i was interested in medicine and thought i could be a fine doctor but i knew i would never be michael debakey but i knew i could be great in public service
clintons interest in law also began in hot springs high when in his latin class he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient roman senator catiline in a mock trial after a vigorous defense that made use of his budding rhetorical and political skills he told the latin teacher elizabeth buck that it made him realize that someday he would study law
clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure both occurring in one was his visit as a boys nation senator to the white house to meet president john f kennedy the other was watching martin luther king jrs i have a dream speech on tv which impressed him enough that he later memorized it

he subsequently decided not to join the rotc saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program he had planned to join that he opposed the war but did not think it was honorable to use rotc national guard or reserve service to avoid serving in vietnam he further stated that because he opposed the war he would not volunteer to serve in uniform but would subject himself to the draft and would serve if selected only as a way to maintain my political viability within the system clinton registered for the draft and received a high number meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers to would have to be drafted before him making it unlikely that he would be drafted in fact the highest number drafted was 
colonel eugene holmes the army officer who had been involved with clintons rotc application suspected that clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform he issued a notarized statement during the presidential campaign
i was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to senator fulbrights office that bill clinton a rhodes scholar should be admitted to the rotc program i believe that he purposely deceived me using the possibility of joining the rotc as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification
during the campaign it was revealed that clintons uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the navy reserve which would have kept him from going to vietnam this effort was unsuccessful and clinton said in that he had been unaware of it until then although legal clintons actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized by conservatives and some vietnam veterans during his first presidential campaign some of whom charged that he had used fulbrights influence to avoid military service clintons campaign manager james carville successfully argued that clintons letter in which he declined to join the rotc should be made public insisting that voters many of whom had also opposed the vietnam war would understand and appreciate his position
