according to the test naep new york city eighth graders have shown no significant improvement in math or reading since they began taking it in mirroring the largely flat performance of american eighth graders as a whole during that period in the city the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lowerincome students
somewho have seen this approach to the new york education system as largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers under the reformed approach a school must do better than the previous year to receive funding because of this requirement many successful schools were closed for being unsuccessful because of their inability to raise test scores even though they were the top performing schools while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly
