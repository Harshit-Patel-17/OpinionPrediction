some critics and historians have contested carsons views in a piece for the huffington post jonathan greenblatt national director and ceo of the antidefamation league wrote it is mindbending to suggest that personal firearms in the hands of the small number of germanys jews about remaining in germany in could have stopped the totalitarian onslaught of nazi germany when the armies of poland france belgium and numerous other countries were overwhelmed by the third reich
others have also defended his views with daniel payne of the federalist writing the issue should not be one of could a civilian militia have defeated the german army and prevented the holocaust rather the question is this if the german government hadnt stripped the german jewish population of arms would it have been easier for the jews to fight back and would more lives have been saved the answer is obviously yes

in october carson said he would beg to differ with people who thought america would never become something akin to nazi germany stating if you go back and look at the history of the world tyranny and despotism and how it starts it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech when questioned about whether he was comparing president obama to hitler carson said no i am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves bad things can happen

carson has been critical of the patient protection and affordable care act in carson said you know obamacare is really i think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery and it is in a way it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government and it was never about health care it was about control
as an alternative to the affordable care act carson says heres my solution when a person is born give him a birth certificate an electronic medical record and a health savings account in a december oped for the washington times carson elaborated we need to remove health care from the political arena and recognize that any government proposals affecting the health of all citizens should be free marketbased and should be so appealing that it would not be necessary to force citizens into the program
to fund health savings accounts carson supports moving dollars out of traditional health care programs like medicaid under a proposal outlined by carson in the government would contribute to each individuals account annually individuals and employers would be permitted to contribute additional funds to the accounts and unspent funds could be shared within a family carson has said that his plan makes every family have their own insurance company
separately from his individualaccount proposal in a oped he called for a system similar to medicare and medicaid for a group that carson terms the percent of patients with complex preexisting or acquired maladies in october carson said if someone preferred the current medicare or medicaid programs to the healthsavingsaccount approach im not going to deny you the privilege of doing that
in a commencement speech at andrews university carson publicly expressed the view that the pyramids of giza were not tombs but grain silos built by joseph the biblical son of jacob in preparation for the famine depicted in the book of genesis he added that various scientists say ancient aliens could have designed the structures but to carson it doesnt require an alien being when god is with you popular in medieval europe the belief that joseph had the pyramids built as granaries was perpetuated by among others gregory of tours in the sixth century an irish monk in the ninth century named bernard a mosaic in st marks basilica dating from the twelfth and the travelogue attributed to john mandeville in the fourteenth
in carson reiterated his views archaeologists disagree saying the pyramids could not be used to store grain because they are not hollow also ancient egyptian granaries have been well studied there is evidence of burials inside the pyramids and the ancient egyptians left funerary instructions inside them additionally the bible states that josephs grain was kept in cities

you know as a christiani have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations and i certainly do and never had any intention of offending anyone what i was basically saying and if anybody was offended i apologize to you but what i was basically saying is that there is no group i wasnt equating those things i dont think theyre equal just you know if you ask me for apple and i give you an orange you would say well thats not an orange and then i say thats a banana thats not an apple either and theres a peach thats not an apple either but it doesnt mean that im equating the banana and the orange and the peach and in the same way im not equating those things
