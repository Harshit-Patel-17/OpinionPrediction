if i read this to you and did not tell you that it was an fbi agent describing what americans had done to prisoners in their control you would most certainly believe this must have been done by nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings sadly that is not the case this was the action of americans in the treatment of their prisoners
