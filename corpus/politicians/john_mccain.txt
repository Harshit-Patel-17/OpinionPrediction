although mccain was badly wounded his captors refused to treat his injuries beating and interrogating him to get information he was given medical care only when the north vietnamese discovered that his father was a highranking admiral his status as a prisoner of war pow made the front pages of major newspapers
mccain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care by then having lost pounds kg in a chest cast and with his gray hair turned white as snow mccain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of hanoi in december into a cell with two other americans who did not expect him to live a week in march mccain was put into solitary confinement where he would remain for two years
in mid john s mccain jr was named commander of all us forces in the vietnam theater and the north vietnamese offered mccain early release because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes and also to show other pows that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially mccain turned down the offer he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well such early release was prohibited by the pows interpretation of the military code of conduct to prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured
in august a program of severe torture began on mccain he was subjected to rope bindings and repeated beatings every two hours at the same time as he was suffering from dysentery further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt stopped by guards eventually mccain made an antiamerican propaganda confession he has always felt that his statement was dishonorable but as he later wrote i had learned what we all learned over there every man has his breaking point i had reached mine many american pows were tortured and maltreated in order to extract confessions and propaganda statements virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors mccain subsequently received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements
mccain refused to meet with various antiwar groups seeking peace in hanoi wanting to give neither them nor the north vietnamese a propaganda victory from late onward treatment of mccain and many of the other pows became more tolerable while mccain continued actively to resist the camp authorities mccain and other prisoners cheered the us christmas bombing campaign of december viewing it as a forceful measure to push north vietnam to terms

mccain developed a reputation for independence during the s he took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces becoming difficult to categorize politically

in and mccain voted to confirm president clintons nominees stephen breyer and ruth bader ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the us supreme court he would later explain that under our constitution it is the presidents call to make mccain had also voted to confirm nominees of presidents ronald reagan and george hw bush including robert bork and clarence thomas
mccain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions from corporations labor unions other organizations and wealthy individuals and he made this his signature issue starting in he worked with democratic wisconsin senator russ feingold on campaign finance reform their mccainfeingold bill attempted to put limits on soft money the efforts of mccain and feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted by incumbents in both parties by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias despite sympathetic coverage in the media initial versions of the mccainfeingold act were filibustered and never came to a vote
the term maverick republican became a label frequently applied to mccain and he has also used it himself in mccain opposed military operations in somalia another target of his was pork barrel spending by congress and he actively supported the line item veto act of which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court in 
in the presidential election mccain was again on the short list of possible vicepresidential picks this time for republican nominee bob dole the following year time magazine named mccain as one of the most influential people in america
in mccain became chairman of the powerful senate commerce committee he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committees purview but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the bigmoney nature of the campaign finance problem mccain took on the tobacco industry in proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund antismoking campaigns discourage teenage smokers increase money for health research studies and help states pay for smokingrelated health care costs supported by the clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most republicans the bill failed to gain cloture

in august mccains memoir faith of my fathers coauthored with mark salter was published a reviewer observed that its appearance seems to have been timed to the unfolding presidential campaign the most successful of his writings it received positive reviews became a bestseller and was later made into a tv film the book traces mccains family background and childhood covers his time at annapolis and his service before and during the vietnam war concluding with his release from captivity in according to one reviewer it describes the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine its a fascinating history of a remarkable military family
mccain announced his candidacy for president on september in nashua new hampshire saying he was staging a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve the leader for the republican nomination was texas governor george w bush who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment
mccain focused on the new hampshire primary where his message appealed to independents he traveled on a campaign bus called the straight talk express he held many town hall meetings answering every question voters asked in a successful example of retail politics and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds one reporter later recounted that mccain talked all day long with reporters on his straight talk express bus he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldnt have and thats why the media loved him on february he won new hampshires primary with percent of the vote to bushs percent the bush campaign and the republican establishment feared that a mccain victory in the crucial south carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum
the arizona republic would write that the mccainbush primary contest in south carolina has entered national political lore as a lowwater mark in presidential campaigns while the new york times called it a painful symbol of the brutality of american politics a variety of interest groups that mccain had challenged in the past ran negative ads bush borrowed mccains earlier language of reform and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused mccain in bushs presence of having abandoned the veterans on powmia and agent orange issues
incensed mccain ran ads accusing bush of lying and comparing the governor to bill clinton which bush said was about as low a blow as you can give in a republican primary an anonymous smear campaign began against mccain delivered by push polls faxes emails flyers and audience plants the smears claimed that mccain had fathered a black child out of wedlock the mccains darkskinned daughter was adopted from bangladesh that his wife cindy was a drug addict that he was a homosexual and that he was a manchurian candidate who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his north vietnam pow days the bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks
mccain lost south carolina on february with percent of the vote to bushs percent in part because bush mobilized the states evangelical voters and outspent mccain the win allowed bush to regain lost momentum mccain would say of the rumor spreaders i believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those according to one report the south carolina experience left mccain in a very dark place
mccains campaign never completely recovered from his south carolina defeat although he did rebound partially by winning in arizona and michigan a few days later he made a speech in virginia beach that criticized christian leaders including pat robertson and jerry falwell as divisive conservatives declaring we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community but that does not mean that we will pander to their selfappointed leaders mccain lost the virginia primary on february and on march lost nine of the thirteen primaries on super tuesday to bush with little hope of overcoming bushs delegate lead mccain withdrew from the race on march he endorsed bush two months later and made occasional appearances with the texas governor during the general election campaign
mccain began by breaking with the new george w bush administration on a number of matters including hmo reform climate change and gun legislation mccainfeingold was opposed by bush as well in may mccain was one of only two senate republicans to vote against the bush tax cuts besides the differences with bush on ideological grounds there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous years campaign later when a republican senator jim jeffords became an independent thereby throwing control of the senate to the democrats mccain defended jeffords against selfappointed enforcers of party loyalty indeed there was speculation at the time and in years since about mccain himself leaving the republican party but mccain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so beginning in mccain used political capital gained from his presidential run as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members to become one of the senates most influential members
after the september attacks mccain supported bush and the usled war in afghanistan he and democratic senator joe lieberman wrote the legislation that created the commission while he and democratic senator fritz hollings cosponsored the aviation and transportation security act that federalized airport security
in march mccainfeingold passed in both houses of congress and was signed into law by president bush seven years in the making it was mccains greatest legislative achievement
meanwhile in discussions over proposed us action against iraq mccain was a strong supporter of the bush administrations position he stated that iraq was a clear and present danger to the united states of america and voted accordingly for the iraq war resolution in october he predicted that us forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the iraqi people in may mccain voted against the second round of bush tax cuts saying it was unwise at a time of war by november after a trip to iraq he was publicly questioning secretary of defense donald rumsfeld saying that more us troops were needed the following year mccain announced that he had lost confidence in rumsfeld
in october mccain and lieberman cosponsored the climate stewardship act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to levels the bill was defeated with votes to in the senate they reintroduced modified versions of the act two additional times most recently in january with the cosponsorship of barack obama among others
in the us presidential election campaign mccain was once again frequently mentioned for the vicepresidential slot only this time as part of the democratic ticket under nominee john kerry mccain said that kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had at the republican national convention mccain supported bush for reelection praising bushs management of the war on terror since the september attacks at the same time he defended kerrys vietnam war record by august mccain had the best favorabletounfavorable rating percent to percent of any national politician he campaigned for bush much more than he had four years previously though the two remained situational allies rather than friends
mccain was also up for reelection as senator in he defeated littleknown democratic schoolteacher stuart starky with his biggest margin of victory garnering percent of the vote
in may mccain led the socalled gang of in the senate which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees but only in extraordinary circumstances the compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement but some republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances mccain subsequently cast supreme court confirmation votes in favor of john roberts and samuel alito calling them two of the finest justices ever appointed to the united states supreme court
breaking from his and votes mccain supported the bush tax cut extension in may saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase working with democratic senator ted kennedy mccain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform which would involve legalization guest worker programs and border enforcement components the secure america and orderly immigration act was never voted on in while the comprehensive immigration reform act of passed the senate in may but failed in the house in june president bush mccain and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill the comprehensive immigration reform act of but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an amnesty program and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the senate
by the middle of the s decade the increased indian gaming that mccain had helped bring about was a billion industry he was twice chairman of the senate indian affairs committee in and and his committee helped expose the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal by and mccain was pushing for amendments to the indian gaming regulatory act that would limit creation of offreservation casinos as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos
owing to his time as a pow mccain has been recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the war on terror in october mccain introduced the mccain detainee amendment to the defense appropriations bill for and the senate voted to support the amendment it prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners including prisoners at guantanamo bay by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the us army field manual on interrogation although bush had threatened to veto the bill if mccains amendment was included the president announced in december that he accepted mccains terms and would make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad this stance among others led to mccain being named by time magazine in as one of americas best senators mccain voted in february against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by bush however the bill in question contained other provisions to which mccain objected and his spokesman stated this wasnt a vote on waterboarding this was a vote on applying the standards of the army field manual to cia personnel
meanwhile mccain continued questioning the progress of the war in iraq in september he remarked upon chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard myers optimistic outlook on the wars progress things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected nor as we were told by you general myers in august he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency we have not told the american people how tough and difficult this could be from the beginning mccain strongly supported the iraq troop surge of the strategys opponents labeled it mccains plan and university of virginia political science professor larry sabato said mccain owns iraq just as much as bush does now the surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year even within the republican party as mccains presidential campaign was underway faced with the consequences mccain frequently responded i would much rather lose a campaign than a war in march mccain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in iraq as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began
mccain formally announced his intention to run for president of the united states on april in portsmouth new hampshire he stated that im not running for president to be somebody but to do something to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things
mccains oftcited strengths as a presidential candidate for included national name recognition sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives his ability to reach across the aisle his wellknown military service and experience as a pow his experience from the presidential campaign and an expectation that he would capture bushs top fundraisers during the election cycle mccain had attended events and helped raise more than million on behalf of republican candidates mccain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make despite being considered the frontrunner for the nomination by pundits as began mccain was in second place behind former mayor of new york city rudy giuliani in national republican polls as the year progressed
mccain had fundraising problems in the first half of due in part to his support for the comprehensive immigration reform act of which was unpopular among the republican base electorate largescale campaign staff downsizing took place in early july but mccain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race later that month the candidates campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed mccain slumped badly in national polls often running third or fourth with percent or less support
the arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog riding the straight talk express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events by december the republican race was unsettled with none of the toptier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the republican base electorate mccain was showing a resurgence in particular with renewed strength in new hampshire the scene of his triumph and was bolstered further by the endorsements of the boston globe the new hampshire union leader and almost two dozen other state newspapers as well as from senator lieberman now an independent democrat mccain decided not to campaign significantly in the january iowa caucuses which saw a win by former governor of arkansas mike huckabee
mccains comeback plan paid off when he won the new hampshire primary on january defeating former governor of massachusetts mitt romney in a close contest to once again become one of the frontrunners in the race in midjanuary mccain placed first in the south carolina primary narrowly defeating mike huckabee pundits credited the thirdplace finisher tennessees former us senator fred thompson with drawing votes from huckabee in south carolina thereby giving a narrow win to mccain a week later mccain won the florida primary beating romney again in a close contest giuliani then dropped out and endorsed mccain
on february mccain won both the majority of states and delegates in the super tuesday republican primaries giving him a commanding lead toward the republican nomination romney departed from the race on february mccains wins in the march primaries clinched a majority of the delegates and he became the presumptive republican nominee
mccain having been born in the panama canal zone if elected would have become the first president who was born outside the current states this raised a potential legal issue since the united states constitution requires the president to be a naturalborn citizen of the united states a bipartisan legal review and a unanimous but nonbinding senate resolution both concluded that he is a naturalborn citizen also if inaugurated in at age years and days he would have been the oldest us president upon ascension to the presidency and the secondoldest president to be inaugurated
mccain addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns stating in that his health was excellent he had been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma and an operation in for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face mccains prognosis appeared favorable according to independent experts especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years in may mccains campaign briefly let the press review his medical records and he was described as appearing cancerfree having a strong heart and in general being in good health
upon clinching enough delegates for the nomination mccains focus shifted toward the general election while barack obama and hillary rodham clinton fought a prolonged battle for the democratic nomination mccain introduced various policy proposals and sought to improve his fundraising cindy mccain who accounts for most of the couples wealth with an estimated net worth of million made part of her tax returns public in may after facing criticism about lobbyists on staff the mccain campaign issued new rules in may to avoid conflicts of interest causing five top aides to leave
when obama became the democrats presumptive nominee in early june mccain proposed joint town hall meetings but obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall in july a staff shakeup put steve schmidt in full operational control of the mccain campaign throughout these summer months obama typically led mccain in national polls by singledigit margins and also led in several key swing states mccain reprised his familiar underdog role which was due at least in part to the overall challenges republicans faced in the election year mccain accepted public financing for the general election campaign and the restrictions that go with it while criticizing his democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in the republicans broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead compared to obamas
alaska governor sarah palin was revealed as mccains surprise choice for running mate on august mccain was only the second us majorparty presidential nominee to select a woman for running mate and the first republican to do so palin would have become the first female vice president of the united states if she had been elected on september mccain and palin became the republican partys presidential and vice presidential nominees respectively at the republican national convention in saint paul minnesota mccain surged ahead of obama in national polls following the convention as the palin pick energized core republican voters who had previously been wary of him however by the campaigns own later admission the rollout of palin to the national media went poorly and voter reactions to palin grew increasingly negative especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications
on september mccain said he was suspending his campaign called on obama to join him and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with obama in order to work on the proposed us financial system bailout before congress which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis mccains intervention helped to give dissatisfied house republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement after obama declined mccains suspension suggestion mccain went ahead with the debate on september on october mccain voted in favor of a revised billion rescue plan another debate was held on october like the first one polls afterward suggested that obama had won it a final presidential debate occurred on october 
during and after the final debate mccain compared obamas proposed policies to socialism and often invoked joe the plumber as a symbol of american small business dreams that would be thwarted by an obama presidency mccain barred using the jeremiah wright controversy in ads against obama but the campaign did frequently criticize obama regarding his purported relationship with bill ayers mccains rallies became increasingly vitriolic with attendees denigrating obama and displaying a growing antimuslim and antiafricanamerican sentiment after one female mccain supporter said she did not trust obama because hes an arab mccain pointedly replied to the woman no maam hes a decent family man citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues mccains response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in american politics down the stretch mccain was outspent by obama by a fourtoone margin
