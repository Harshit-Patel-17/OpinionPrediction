rodham began a year of postgraduate study on children and medicine at the yale child study center her first scholarly article children under the law was published in the harvard educational review in late discussing the new childrens rights movement it stated that child citizens were powerless individuals and argued that children should not be considered equally incompetent from birth to attaining legal age but that instead courts should presume competence except when there is evidence otherwise on a casebycase basis the article became frequently cited in the field

by then rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future democratic political organizer and consultant betsey wright had moved from texas to washington the previous year to help guide her career and wright thought rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president meanwhile clinton had repeatedly asked rodham to marry him and she continued to demur after failing the district of columbia bar exam and passing the arkansas exam rodham came to a key decision as she later wrote i chose to follow my heart instead of my head she thus followed bill clinton to arkansas rather than staying in washington where career prospects were brighter he was then teaching law and running for a seat in the us house of representatives in his home state in august rodham moved to fayetteville arkansas and became one of only two female faculty members in the school of law at the university of arkansas fayetteville

hillary rodham and bill clinton bought a house in fayetteville in the summer of and hillary finally agreed to marry bill their wedding took place on october in a methodist ceremony in their living room a story about the marriage in the arkansas gazette indicated that she was retaining the name hillary rodham the motivation was to keep the couples professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because as she told a friend at the time it showed that i was still me the decision did upset both their mothers bill clinton had lost the congressional race in but in november was elected arkansas attorney general and so the couple moved to the state capital of little rock there in february rodham joined the venerable rose law firm a bastion of arkansan political and economic influence she specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property law while also working pro bono in child advocacy she rarely performed litigation work in court
rodham maintained her interest in childrens law and family policy publishing the scholarly articles childrens policies abandonment and neglect in and childrens rights a legal perspective in the latter continued her argument that childrens legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases judicial intervention was sometimes warranted an american bar association chair later said her articles were important not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate historian garry wills would later describe her as one of the more important scholaractivists of the last two decades while conservatives said her theories would usurp traditional parental authority would allow children to file frivolous lawsuits against their parents and exemplified legal crit theory run amok
in rodham cofounded arkansas advocates for children and families a statelevel alliance with the childrens defense fund later that year president jimmy carter for whom rodham had been the campaign director of field operations in indiana appointed her to the board of directors of the legal services corporation and she served in that capacity from until the end of from mid to midnb she was the chair of that board the first woman to do so during her time as chair funding for the corporation was expanded from million to million subsequently she successfully fought president ronald reagans attempts to reduce the funding and change the nature of the organization

clinton continued to practice law with the rose law firm while she was first lady of arkansas she earned less than the other partners as she billed fewer hours but still made more than in her final year there the firm considered her a rainmaker because she brought in clients partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections she was also very influential in the appointment of state judges bill clintons republican opponent in his gubernatorial reelection campaign accused the clintons of conflict of interest because rose law did state business the clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated
from to clinton was on the board of directors sometimes as chair of the new world foundation which funded a variety of new left interest groups from to she was the first chair of the american bar associations commission on women in the profession created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the association to adopt measures to combat it she was twice named by the national law journal as one of the most influential lawyers in america in and in when bill clinton thought about not running again for governor in hillary considered running but private polls were unfavorable and in the end he ran and was reelected for the final time

some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy supporters pointed out that clintons role in policy was no different from that of other white house advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husbands presidency bill clintons campaign promise of two for the price of one led opponents to refer derisively to the clintons as copresidents or sometimes the arkansas label billary the pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send clinton into imaginary discussions with the alsopoliticallyactive eleanor rooseveltnb from the time she came to washington she also found refuge in a prayer group of the fellowship that featured many wives of conservative washington figures triggered in part by the death of her father in april she publicly sought to find a synthesis of methodist teachings liberal religious political philosophy and tikkun editor michael lerners politics of meaning to overcome what she saw as americas sleeping sickness of the soul that would lead to a willingness to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century moving into a new millennium other segments of the public focused on her appearance which had evolved over time from inattention to fashion during her days in arkansas to a popular site in the early days of the world wide web devoted to showing her many different and frequently analyzed hairstyles as first lady to an appearance on the cover of vogue magazine in 
in january president clinton named first lady clinton to chair a task force on national health care reform hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for arkansas education reform unconvinced regarding the merits of the north american free trade agreement nafta she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority the recommendation of the task force became known as the clinton health care plan a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations its opponents quickly derided the plan as hillarycare and it faced opposition from even some democrats in congress some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a july bus tour to rally support for the plan clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times
failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the house or the senate although democrats controlled both chambers the proposal was abandoned in september clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors the first ladys approval ratings which had generally been in the highs percent range during her first year fell to percent in april and percent by september 
republicans made the clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the midterm elections which saw a net republican gain of fiftythree seats in the house election and seven in the senate election winning control of both many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the democrats defeat especially among independent voters the white house subsequently sought to downplay hillary clintons role in shaping policy opponents of universal health care would continue to use hillarycare as a pejorative label for similar plans by others
along with senators ted kennedy and orrin hatch she was a force behind the passage of the state childrens health insurance program in a federal effort that provided state support for children whose parents could not provide them with health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law she promoted nationwide immunization against childhood illnesses and encouraged older women to seek a mammogram to detect breast cancer with coverage provided by medicare she successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the national institutes of health the first lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the gulf war which became known as the gulf war syndrome
enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of her husbands but when the first two bills on it came from the republicancontrolled congress lacked protections for people going off welfare she urged him to veto them which he did a third version came up during his general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas critics including her past mentor edelman urged her to get the president to veto it again but she decided to support the bill which became the welfare reform act of as the best political compromise available this caused a rift with edelman that clinton later called sad and painful
together with attorney general janet reno clinton helped create the office on violence against women at the department of justice in she initiated and shepherded the adoption and safe families act which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady in she was instrumental in the passage of the foster care independence act which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care as first lady clinton hosted numerous white house conferences including ones on child care on early childhood development and learning and on children and adolescents she also hosted the firstever white house conference on teenagers and the firstever white house conference on philanthropy 
clinton traveled to countries during this time breaking the mark for mosttraveled first lady held by pat nixon she did not hold a security clearance or attend national security council meetings but played a role in us diplomacy attaining its objectives a march fivenation trip to south asia on behest of the us state department and without her husband sought to improve relations with india and pakistan clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the american press corps the trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy
in a september speech before the fourth world conference on women in beijing clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the peoples republic of china itself declaring that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights delegates from over countries heard her say if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference let it be that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all in doing so she resisted both internal administration and chinese pressure to soften her remarks the speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later females around the world would recite clintons key phrases she was one of the most prominent international figures during the late s to speak out against the treatment of afghan women by the taliban she helped create vital voices an international initiative sponsored by the us to promote the participation of women in the political processes of their countries it and clintons own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the northern ireland peace process
first lady clinton was a subject of several investigations by the united states office of the independent counsel committees of the us congress and the press
the whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a new york times report during the presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady the clintons had lost their lates investment in the whitewater development corporation at the same time their partners in that investment jim and susan mcdougal operated madison guaranty a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of rose law firm and may have been improperly subsidizing whitewater losses madison guaranty later failed and clintons work at rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed she said she had done minimal work for the bank independent counsels robert fiske and kenneth starr subpoenaed clintons legal billing records she said she did not know where they were the records were found in the first ladys white house book room after a twoyear search and delivered to investigators in early the delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been clintons staff attributed the problem to continual changes in white house storage areas since the move from the arkansas governors mansion on january clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury after several independent counsels had investigated a final report was issued in that stated there was insufficient evidence that either clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing
scrutiny of the may firings of the white house travel office employees an affair that became known as travelgate began with charges that the white house had used audited financial irregularities in the travel office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from arkansas the discovery of a twoyearold white house memo caused the investigation to focus on whether hillary clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true the final independent counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made factually false statements but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings to prosecute her
following deputy white house counsel vince fosters july suicide allegations were made that hillary clinton had ordered the removal of potentially damaging files related to whitewater or other matters from fosters office on the night of his death independent counsel kenneth starr investigated this and by starr was reported to be holding the investigation open despite his staff having told him there was no case to be made when starrs successor robert ray issued his final whitewater reports in no claims were made against hillary clinton regarding this
an outgrowth of the travelgate investigation was the june discovery of improper white house access to hundreds of fbi background reports on former republican white house employees an affair that some called filegate accusations were made that hillary clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the white house security office the final independent counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that hillary clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter
in march newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from trading in thus leading to the cattle futures controversy allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing
there was a controversy that arose in early over gifts made to the white house rather than to the clintons personally that were removed and shipped to the clintons private residence during the last year of bill clintons time in office following public pressure the couple returned worth of such gifts hillary clinton faced additional criticism for having possibly solicited personal gifts shortly before being sworn in as a senator at which time she would have been barred from accepting them
in the clintons relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with white house intern monica lewinsky events surrounding the lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of bill clinton by the house of representatives and later acquittal by the senate when the allegations against her husband were first made public hillary clinton stated that they were the result of a vast rightwing conspiracy characterizing the lewinsky charges as the latest in a long organized collaborative series of charges by bill clintons political enemiesnb rather than any wrongdoing by her husband she later said that she had been misled by her husbands initial claims that no affair had taken place after the evidence of president clintons encounters with lewinsky became incontrovertible she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage the white house residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period
public reaction varied some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public some sympathized with her as a victim of her husbands insensitive behavior others criticized her as being an enabler to her husbands indiscretions while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around percent the highest they had ever been in her memoir she would attribute her decision to stay married to a love that has persisted for decades and add no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way bill does even after all these years he is still the most interesting energizing and fully alive person i have ever met
matters surrounding the lewinsky scandal left bill clinton with substantial legal bills in hillary clinton would state that she and bill had left the white house not only dead broke but in debt the statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earnings potential of presidents upon leaving office as well as the couples ability to secure loans from banks

nearly emails contained in clintons server were retroactively marked classified by the state department though none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent were later classified as secret more than were designated top secret and the rest were later designated as confidential
however the intelligence communitys inspector general wrote congress to say that some of the emails contained classified state department information when originated in a joint statement released on july the inspector general of the state department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that through their review of the emails they found information that was classified when sent remained so as of their inspection and never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system they also stated unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems mrs clinton had stated over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house
government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such after allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the socalled born classified category an fbi probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the clinton server in may the inspector general of the state department criticized her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state stating that she had not requested permission to use it and even if she had she would not have been given permission
