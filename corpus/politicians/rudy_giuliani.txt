on december one month after the election of ronald reagan brought republicans back to power in washington he switched his party affiliation from independent to republican giuliani later said the switches were because he found democratic policies nave and that by the time i moved to washington the republicans had come to make more sense to me others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the justice department giulianis mother maintained in that
he only became a republican after he began to get all these jobs from them hes definitely not a conservative republican he thinks he is but he isnt he still feels very sorry for the poor

in giuliani was appointed us attorney for the southern district of new york which was technically a demotion but was sought by giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases it was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous highprofile cases resulting in the convictions of wall street figures ivan boesky and michael milken he also focused on prosecuting drug dealers organized crime and corruption in government he amassed a record of convictions and reversals as a federal prosecutor giuliani was credited with bringing the perp walk parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media into common use as a prosecutorial tool after giuliani patented the perp walk the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide
giulianis critics claim he arranged public arrests of people then dropped charges for lack of evidence on highprofile cases rather than going to trial in a few cases his public arrests of alleged whitecollar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened sparked controversy and damaged the reputations of the alleged perps he claimed that veteran stock trader richard wigton of kidder peabody co was guilty of insider trading in february he had officers handcuff wigton and march him through the companys trading floor with wigton in tears giuliani had his agents arrest tim tabor a young arbitrageur and former colleague of wigton so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond within three months charges were dropped against both wigton and tabor giuliani said were not going to go to trial were just the tip of the iceberg but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until giulianis successor was in place giulianis highprofile raid of the princetonnewport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes
in the mafia commission trial february november giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures including the heads of new yorks socalled five families under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico on charges including extortion labor racketeering and murder for hire time magazine called this case of cases possibly the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the chicago mafia was swept away in and quoted giulianis stated intention our approach is to wipe out the five families eight defendants were found guilty on all counts and subsequently sentenced on january to hundreds of years of prison time
according to an fbi memo revealed about years later leaders of the five new york mob families voted in on whether to issue a contract for the death of us attorney rudolph giuliani heads of the lucchese bonanno and genovese families rejected the idea though gambino leader john gotti encouraged assassination
ivan boesky was a wall street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about million by betting on corporate takeovers he was investigated by the us securities and exchange commission sec for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders these stock acquisitions were sometimes brazen with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover although insider trading of this kind was illegal laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until boesky was prosecuted boesky cooperated with the sec and informed on several others including junk bond trader michael milken per agreement with giuliani boesky received a year prison sentence along with a million fine in giuliani charged milken under the rico act with counts of racketeering and fraud in a highly publicized case milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges
giuliani was us attorney until january resigning as the reagan administration ended he garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions he joined the law firm white case in new york city as a partner he remained with white case until may when he joined the law firm anderson kill olick oshinsky also in new york city
giuliani first ran for new york city mayor in attempting to unseat threeterm incumbent ed koch he won the september republican party primary election against business magnate ronald lauder in a campaign marked by claims that giuliani was not a true republican and by an acrimonious debate in the democratic primary koch was upset by manhattan borough president david dinkins
in the general election giuliani ran as the fusion candidate of both the republican and liberal parties the conservative party which had often colined the republican party candidate withheld support from giuliani and ran lauder instead conservative party leaders were unhappy with giuliani on ideological grounds they cited the liberal partys endorsement statement that giuliani agreed with the liberal partys views on affirmative action gay rights gun control school prayer and tuition tax credits
during two televised debates giuliani framed himself as an agent of change saying im the reformer that if we keep going merrily along this citys going down and that electing dinkins would represent more of the same more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down giuliani pointed out that dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and of several other ethical missteps in particular a stock transfer to his son dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off denied other wrongdoing and said that what we need is a mayor not a prosecutor and that giuliani refused to say the rwordhe doesnt like to admit hes a republican dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily new york newspapers while giuliani won approval from the new york post
in the end giuliani lost to dinkins by a margin of votes out of votes cast in the closest election in new york citys history the closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy considering the small percentage of new york city residents who are registered republicans and resulted in giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with dinkins at the next election
four years after he was beaten by dinkins giuliani again ran for mayor once again giuliani also ran on the liberal party line but not the conservative party line which ran activist george marlin the city was suffering from a spike in unemployment associated with the nationwide recession with local unemployment rates going from in to in and a sharp spike in crime with record numbers of murders and other violent crimes
giuliani promised to focus the police department on shutting down petty crimes and nuisances as a way of restoring the quality of life
its the street tax paid to drunks and panhandlers its the squeegee men shaking down the motorist waiting at a light its the trash storms the swirling mass of garbage left by peddlers and panhandlers and openair drug bazaars on unclean streets
dinkins and giuliani never debated during the campaign because they were never able to agree on how to approach a debate dinkins was endorsed by the new york times and newsday while giuliani was endorsed by the new york post and in a key switch from the daily news giuliani came to visit the late lubavitcher rebbe rabbi menachem mendel schneerson seeking his blessing and endorsement
giuliani won by a margin of votes he became the first republican elected mayor of new york city since john lindsay in 
giulianis opponent in was democratic manhattan borough president ruth messinger who had beaten al sharpton in the september democratic primary in the general election giuliani once again had the liberal party and not the conservative party listing giuliani ran an aggressive campaign parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city giulianis popularity was at its highest point to date with a late october quinnipiac university polling institute poll showing him as having a percent approval rating percent of new yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously
throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fundraising advantage over messinger on her part messinger lost the support of several usually democratic constituencies including gay organizations and large labor unions the local daily newspapersthe new york times daily news new york post and newsdayall endorsed giuliani over messinger
in the end giuliani won of the vote to messingers and became the first registered republican to win a second term as mayor while on the republican line since fiorello h la guardia in voter turnout was the lowest in years with of registered voters casting ballots the margin of victory included gains in his share of the african american vote compared to s and the hispanic vote from while maintaining his base of white ethnic catholic and jewish voters from 
giuliani served as mayor of new york city from through 
in giulianis first term as mayor the new york city police department at the instigation of commissioner bill bratton adopted an aggressive enforcementdeterrent strategy based on james q wilsons broken windows approach this involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti turnstile jumping cannabis possession and aggressive panhandling by squeegee men on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained the legal underpinning for removing the squeegee men from the streets was developed under giulianis predecessor mayor david dinkins bratton with deputy commissioner jack maple also created and instituted compstat a computerdriven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data the compstat initiative won the innovations in government award from the kennedy school of government
during giulianis administration crime rates continued to drop in new york city which giulianis presidential campaign website credited to his leadership the extent to which giuliani deserves the credit is disputed crime rates in new york city had started to drop in under previous mayor david dinkins three years before giuliani took office under dinkinss safe streets safe cities program crime in new york city decreased more dramatically and more rapidly both in terms of actual numbers and percentage than at any time in modern new york city history the rates of most crimes including all categories of violent crime made consecutive declines during the last months of dinkinss fouryear term ending a year upward spiral a small nationwide drop in crime preceded giulianis election and critics say that he may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress additional contributing factors to the overall decline in new york city crime during the s were the addition of officers to the nypd lobbied for and hired by the dinkins administration and an overall improvement in the national economy changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions which were similar across the country during this time because the crime index is based on that of the fbi which is selfreported by police departments some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the fbi doesnt collect
giulianis supporters cite studies concluding that the decline in new york citys crime rate in the s and s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country what university of california sociologist frank zimring calls the most focused form of policing in history in his book the great american crime decline zimring argues that up to half of new yorks crime drop in the s and virtually percent of its continuing crime decline since has resulted from policing
bratton was featured on the cover of time in giuliani reportedly forced bratton out after two years in what was generally seen as a battle of two large egos in which giuliani was not tolerant of brattons celebrity bratton went on to become chief of the los angeles police department giulianis term also saw allegations of civil rights abuses and other police misconduct under other commissioners after brattons departure there were police shootings of unarmed suspects and the scandals surrounding the torture of abner louima and the killings of amadou diallo and patrick dorismond giuliani supported the new york police department for example by releasing what he called dorismonds extensive criminal record to the public including a sealed juvenile file
the giuliani administration advocated the privatization of failing public schools and increasing school choice through a voucherbased system giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants he continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the immigration and naturalization service about immigration violations on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation
during his mayoralty gay and lesbian new yorkers received domestic partnership rights giuliani induced the citys democraticcontrolled new york city council which had avoided the issue for years to pass legislation providing broad protection for samesex partners in he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners
several of giulianis appointees to head city agencies became defendants in criminal proceedings
in giuliani appointed yearold russell harding the son of liberal party of new york leader and longtime giuliani mentor raymond harding to head the new york city housing development corporation although harding had neither a college degree nor relevant experience in harding pleaded guilty to defrauding the housing development corporation and to possession of child pornography he was sentenced to five years in prison russell harding committed suicide in 
in a related matter richard roberts appointed by giuliani as housing commissioner and as chairman of the health and hospitals corporation pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a grand jury about a car that harding bought for him with city funds
giuliani was a longtime backer of bernard kerik who started out as a nypd detective driving for giulianis campaign giuliani appointed him as the commissioner of the department of correction and then as the police commissioner giuliani was also the godfather to keriks two youngest children after giuliani left office kerik pleaded guilty to state corruption charges dating from his corrections days kerik is currently awaiting trial on related federal charges of conspiracy tax fraud and obstruction of justice giuliani has not been implicated in any of the kerik scandals
due to term limits giuliani could not run in for a third term as mayor in november fourterm incumbent democratic us senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement and giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the election for the nowopen seat due to his high profile and visibility giuliani was supported by the state republican party giulianis entrance led democratic congressman charles rangel and others to recruit thenus first lady hillary rodham clinton to run for moynihans seat hoping she might combat his star power
an early january poll showed giuliani trailing clinton by points in april giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the senate run by january giuliani had reversed the polls situation pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by clinton nevertheless the giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses so closely identified with new york city he had somewhat limited appeal to normally republican voters in upstate new york the new york police departments fatal shooting of patrick dorismond in march inflamed giulianis already strained relations with the citys minority communities and clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue by april reports showed clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking giuliani who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more clinton was now to points ahead of giuliani in the polls
then followed four tumultuous weeks in which giulianis medical life romantic life marital life and political life all collided at once in a most visible fashion giuliani discovered that he had prostate cancer and needed treatment his extramarital relationship with judith nathan became public and the subject of a media frenzy he announced a separation from his wife donna hanover and after much indecision on may he announced his withdrawal from the senate race
giuliani has been criticized for ignoring the ongoing threat to new york city from islamist terrorism in the years between the world trade center bombings and september 
prior to september giuliani reportedly never referred to the bombing publicly except for a single metaphorical reference in his inaugural address not referring to terrorism giuliani also reportedly never discussed the threat of terrorism with the us attorney in his district and had to ask henry kissinger for background information on osama bin laden after the september th attacks despite the fact that bin laden had previously declared a fatwa against the united states the clinton administration had established a section of the cia devoted exclusively to hunting bin laden
jerome hauer giulianis emergency management chief between and later said that we never talked about islamic terrorism we talked about chemical terrorism biological terrorism we did talk about car bombs every now and then but i dont think there was much interest on his part in islam terrorism
giuliani was prominent in the aftermath of the september attacks on the world trade center he made frequent appearances on radio and television on september and afterwardsfor example to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack in his public statements giuliani said
tomorrow new york is going to be here and were going to rebuild and were going to be stronger than we were before i want the people of new york to be an example to the rest of the country and the rest of the world that terrorism cant stop us
the attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the democratic and republican candidates to succeed giuliani the primary was immediately delayed two weeks to september during this period giuliani sought an unprecedented threemonth emergency extension of his term from january to april under the new york state constitution article section he threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full fouryear term if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty in the end leaders in the state assembly and senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary the election proceeded as scheduled and the winning candidate the giulianiendorsed republican convert michael bloomberg took office on january per normal custom
giuliani claimed to have been at the ground zero site as often if not more than most workers i was there working with them i was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to so in that sense im one of them some workers have objected to those claims while his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks giuliani spent a total of hours over three months at the site this contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days
when saudi prince alwaleed bin talal suggested that the attacks were an indication that the united states should reexamine its policies in the middle east and adopt a more balanced stand toward the palestinian cause giuliani asserted there is no moral equivalent for this act there is no justification for it and one of the reasons i think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the united states like israel and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism so i think not only are those statements wrong theyre part of the problem giuliani subsequently rejected the princes million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack
giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the office of emergency management headquarters on the rd floor inside the world trade center building those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the world trade center in the office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in world trade to power the command center in may giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on jerome m hauer who had served under giuliani from to before being appointed by him as new york citys first director of emergency management hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided fox news and new york magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in brooklyn but was overruled by giuliani television journalist chris wallace interviewed giuliani on may about his decision to locate the command center at the world trade center giuliani laughed during wallaces questions and said that hauer recommended the world trade center site and claimed that hauer said that the wtc site was the best location wallace presented giuliani a photocopy of hauers directive letter the letter urged giuliani to locate the command center in brooklyn instead of lower manhattan the february memo read the brooklyn building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in lower manhattan
in january an eightpage memo was revealed which detailed the new york city police departments opposition in to location of the citys emergency command center at the trade center site the giuliani administration overrode these concerns
the commission report noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks the commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the world trade center bombings family members of victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years the radios were not working when fire department chiefs ordered the firefighters inside the towers to evacuate and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed however when giuliani testified before the commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives giuliani testified to the commission where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements a mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty replacement radios were purchased in a million nobid contract with motorola and implemented in early however the radios were recalled in march after a probationary firefighters calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene leaving firemen with the old analog radios from a book later published by commission members thomas kean and lee h hamilton without precedent the inside story of the commission argued that the commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with giuliani
an october study by the national institute of environmental safety and health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear
in the wake of the attacks giuliani gained international attention and was widely hailed for his leadership during the crisis when polled just six weeks after the attack giuliani received a percent approval rating among new york city voters a dramatic increase over the percent rating he had received a year earlieraverage at the end of a twoterm mayorship oprah winfrey called him americas mayor at a memorial service held at yankee stadium on september other voices denied it was the mayor who had pulled the city together you didnt bring us together our pain brought us together and our decency brought us together we would have come together if bozo was the mayor said civil rights activist al sharpton in a statement largely supported by fernando ferrer one of three main candidates for the mayoralty at the end of he was a powerhungry person sharpton also said
on december time magazine named giuliani its person of the year for time observed that prior to the public image of giuliani had been that of a rigid selfrighteous ambitious politician after and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis historian vincent j cannato concluded in september 
with time giulianis legacy will be based on more than just he left a city immeasurably better offsafer more prosperous more confidentthan the one he had inherited eight years earlier even with the smoldering ruins of the world trade center at its heart debates about his accomplishments will continue but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny
giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts but others argue that giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks casting himself as a hero for political gain giuliani has collected million from speaking fees in a single year his demand increasing after the attacks before september giulianis assets were estimated to be somewhat less than million but his net worth could now be as high as times that amount he has made most of his money since leaving office
for his leadership on and after september giuliani was given an honorary knighthood kbe by queen elizabeth ii on february 
giuliani initially downplayed the health effects arising from the september attacks in the financial district and lower manhattan areas in the vicinity of the world trade center site he moved quickly to reopen wall street and it was reopened on september in the first month after the attacks he said the air quality is safe and acceptable however in the weeks after the attacks the united states geological survey identified hundreds of asbestos hot spots of debris dust that remained on buildings by the end of the month the usgs reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner it would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower manhattan and brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials the citys health agencies such as the department of environmental protection did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings instead the city left this responsibility to building owners
giuliani took control away from agencies such as the federal emergency management agency the army corps of engineers and the occupational safety and health administration leaving the largely unknown city department of design and construction in charge of recovery and cleanup documents indicate that the giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators concurrently the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed in june christie todd whitman former republican governor of new jersey and director of the environmental protection agency epa reportedly stated that the epa had pushed for workers at the wtc site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by giuliani she stated that she believed that the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by wtc responders were a result of these actions however former deputy mayor joe lhota then with the giuliani campaign replied all workers at ground zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators
giuliani asked the citys congressional delegation to limit the citys liability for ground zero illnesses be limited to a total of million two years after giuliani finished his term fema appropriated billion to a special insurance fund called the world trade center captive insurance company to protect the city against lawsuits
in february the international association of fire fighters issued a letter asserting that giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from world trade center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered mayor giulianis actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at ground zero forever with no closure for families or be removed like garbage and deposited at the fresh kills landfill it said adding hundreds remained entombed in ground zero when giuliani gave up on them lawyers for the international association of fire fighters seek to interview giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that new york city negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the fresh kills landfill
since leaving office as mayor giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for republican candidates for political offices at all levels as the first republicans to simultaneously serve as mayor and governor of new york since nelson rockefeller and john lindsay giuliani and governor george pataki were instrumental in bringing the republican national convention to new york city he was a speaker at the convention and endorsed president george w bush for reelection by recalling that immediately after the world trade center towers fell
without really thinking based on just emotion spontaneous i grabbed the arm of thenpolice commissioner bernard kerik and i said to him bernie thank god george bush is our president
similarly in june giuliani started a website called solutions america to help elect republican candidates across the nation
after campaigning on bushs behalf in the us presidential election of he was reportedly the top choice for secretary of homeland security after tom ridges resignation when suggestions were made that giulianis confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former new york police commissioner bernard kerik after the formal announcement of keriks nomination information about keriks pastmost notably that he had ties to organized crime failed to properly report gifts he had received had been sued for sexual harassment and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servantbecame known and kerik withdrew his nomination
in november giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for president of the united states in in february he filed a statement of candidacy and confirmed on the television program larry king live that he was indeed running
early polls showed giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition and support among the republican candidates throughout most of he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among republicans senator john mccain who ranked a close second behind the new york mayor had faded and most polls showed giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared republican candidates with only former senator fred thompson and former governor mitt romney showing greater support in some perstate republican polls on november giulianis campaign received an endorsement from evangelist christian broadcasting network founder and past presidential candidate pat robertson this was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights
giulianis campaign hit a difficult stretch during november and december during which time bernard kerik whom giuliani had recommended for the position of secretary of homeland security was indicted on counts of tax fraud and other federal charges the media reported that while mayor of new york giuliani had billed to obscure city agencies several tens of thousands of dollars of mayoral security expenses incurred while visiting judith nathan with whom he was having an extramarital affair later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding nathan and several stories were published in the press regarding clients of giuliani partners and bracewell giuliani being in opposition to goals of american foreign policy giulianis national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later multiprimary big states rather than the smaller firstvoting states was seen at risk
despite his strategy giuliani did compete to a substantial extent in the january new hampshire primary but finished a distant fourth with percent of the vote similar poor results continued in other early contests as giulianis staff went without pay in order to focus all efforts on the crucial late january florida republican primary the shift of the electorates focus from national security to the state of the economy also hurt giuliani as did the resurgence of mccains similarly themed campaign on january giuliani finished a distant third in the florida result with percent of the vote trailing mccain and romney facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large super tuesday states including that of his home new york giuliani withdrew from the race on january endorsing mccain
