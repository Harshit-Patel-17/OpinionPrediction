because jfks eldest brother had been the familys political standardbearer and tapped by his father to seek the presidency joes death in changed that course and the task now fell to jack
in us representative james michael curley vacated his seat in the strongly democratic th congressional district in massachusettsat the urging of kennedys fatherto become mayor of boston kennedy ran for the seat beating his republican opponent by a large margin in november he served as a congressman for six years
in the us senate election kennedy defeated incumbent republican henry cabot lodge ii for the us senate seat the following year he married jacqueline bouvier
kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years often absent from the senate he was at times critically ill and received catholic last rites during his convalescence in he published profiles in courage a book about us senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs for which he won the pulitzer prize for biography in rumors that this work was cowritten by his close adviser and speechwriter ted sorensen were confirmed in sorensens autobiography
at the democratic national convention presidential nominee adlai stevenson let the convention select the vice presential nominee kennedy finished second in the balloting losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee kennedy received national exposure from that episode his father thought it just as well that kennedy lost due to the potential political debility of his catholicism and the strength of the eisenhower ticket
one of the matters demanding kennedys attention in the senate was president eisenhowers bill for the civil rights act of kennedy cast a procedural vote on this which was considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill kennedy did vote for title iii of the act which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin but majority leader lyndon b johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure kennedy also voted for title iv termed the jury trial amendment many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act a final compromise bill which kennedy supported was passed in september 
in kennedy was reelected to a second term in the senate defeating his republican opponent boston lawyer vincent j celeste by a wide margin it was during his reelection campaign that kennedys press secretary at this time robert e thompson put together a film entitled the us senator john f kennedy story which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the innerworkings of his office it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time
while kennedys father was a strong supporter of senator joseph mccarthy mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family as well bobby kennedy worked for mccarthys subcommittee and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia in the senate voted to censure mccarthy and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure the speech however was not delivered because of kennedys hospitalization at the time the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted the episode damaged kennedys support among members of the liberal community including eleanor roosevelt in the and elections
on january kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the democratic primary election where he faced challenges from senator hubert humphrey of minnesota and senator wayne morse of oregon kennedy defeated humphrey in wisconsin and west virginia morse in maryland and oregon as well as token opposition often writein candidates in new hampshire indiana and nebraska
kennedy visited a coal mine in west virginia most miners and others in that predominantly conservative protestant state were quite wary of kennedys roman catholicism his victory in west virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal
at the democratic convention he gave his wellknown new frontier speech saying for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all wonand we stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promisesit is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them
with humphrey and morse eliminated kennedys main opponent at the los angeles convention was senator lyndon b johnson of texas kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones from adlai stevenson the democratic nominee in and stuart symington and several favorite sons and on july the democratic convention nominated kennedy as its candidate kennedy asked johnson to be his vice presidential candidate despite opposition from many liberal delegates and kennedys own staff including his brother bobby
kennedy needed johnsons strength in the south to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedys roman catholicism cuba and whether the soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decisionmaking he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september i am not the catholic candidate for president i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me kennedy questioned rhetorically whether onequarter of americans were relegated to secondclass citizenship just because they were catholic and once stated that no one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific
in september and october kennedy appeared with republican candidate richard nixon then vice president in the first televised us presidential debates in us history during these programs nixon with a sore injured leg and his five oclock shadow was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable while kennedy choosing to avail himself of makeup services appeared relaxed leading the huge television audience to favor kennedy as the winner radio listeners either thought nixon had won or that the debates were a draw the debates are now considered a milestone in american political historythe point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics
kennedys campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls on november kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the th century in the national popular vote kennedy led nixon by just twotenths of one percent to while in the electoral college he won votes to nixons were needed to win
fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma kennedy was the youngest man elected president succeeding eisenhower who was then the oldest ronald reagan surpassed eisenhower as the oldest president in 
john f kennedy was sworn in as the th president at noon on january in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens famously saying ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself
he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us begin in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you
the address reflected kennedys confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration
kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decisionmaking structure of formergeneral eisenhower and he wasted no time in dismantling eisenhowers methods kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet we can learn our jobs together he stated
much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda the president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism and kennedy abruptly cut him off asking what do you want me to do about that today
kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamaras controversial decision to award the contract for the f tfx tactical fighter experimental fighterbomber to general dynamics the choice of the civilian defense department over boeing the choice of the military at the request of senator henry jackson senator john mcclellan held days of mostly closeddoor hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from februarynovember 
president kennedys foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war in kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the president started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june 
on the way to the summit kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle who advised kennedy to ignore khrushchevs abrasive style the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe nevertheless de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris
on june the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received khrushchev for his part was impressed with the presidents intelligence but thought him weak kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin he made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war
shortly after the president returned home the ussr announced its intention to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any thirdparty occupation rights in either sector of the city kennedy depressed and angry assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he personally thought had a oneinfive chance of occurring
in the weeks immediately after the vienna summit more than people fled from east berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the ussr kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies in a july speech kennedy announced his decision to add billion to the defense budget along with over additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us the speech received an approval rating
the following month the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall kennedys initial reaction was to ignore this as long as free access from west to east berlin continued this course was altered when it was learned that the west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states kennedy sent vice president johnson along with a host of military personnel in convoy through west germany including sovietarmed checkpoints to demonstrate the continued commitment of the us to west berlin
kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may regarding americas conduct in the emerging cold war the address detailed how american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying that for we too founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule
the prior eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow the fidel castro regime in cuba the plan led by the central intelligence agency cia with help from the us military was for an invasion of cuba by a counterrevolutionary insurgency composed of ustrained anticastro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people in hopes of removing castro from power
on april kennedy ordered what became known as the bay of pigs invasion ustrained cubans called brigade landed on the island no us air support was provided allen dulles director of the cia later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground
by april the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the survivors after twenty months cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for million worth of food and medicine the incident made castro wary of the us and led him to believe another invasion would occur
according to biographer richard reeves kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations when it failed he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it but maybe well learn something from it
in late the white house formed the special group augmented headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others the groups objectiveto overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tacticswas never pursued
on october cia u spy planes took photographs of intermediaterange ballistic missile sites being built in cuba by the soviets the photos were shown to kennedy on october a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat
kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the ussr but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from closerange nuclear weapons the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit
more than a third of the members of the national security council nsc favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse there was also some reaction from the international community asked in confidence that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of us missiles that had been placed in turkey by eisenhower there could also be no assurance that the assault would be effective in concurrence with a majorityvote of the nsc kennedy decided on a naval quarantine on october he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv
the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail united nations un secretary general u thant requested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a coolingoff period khrushchev said yes but kennedy said no
one sovietflagged ship was stopped and boarded on october khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm polaris missiles
this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since in the end the humanity of the two men prevailed the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the presidents credibility kennedys approval rating increased from to immediately thereafter
arguing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region he worked closely with governor of puerto rico luis muoz marn for the development of the alliance of progress and began working towards the autonomy of the commonwealth of puerto rico
when the president took office the eisenhower administration through the cia had begun formulating plans for the assassination of castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic kennedy privately instructed the cia that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the us his public position was in opposition in june the dominican republics leader was assassinated in the days following the event undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation robert kennedy who saw an opportunity for the us called bowles a gutless bastard to his face
as one of his first presidential acts kennedy asked congress to create the peace corps his brotherinlaw sargent shriver was the first director through this program americans volunteer to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as education farming health care and construction the organization grew to members by march and the following year since over americans have joined the peace corps serving in countries
when briefing kennedy eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle in regards to the regional threat in march kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos indicating privately that vietnam and not laos should be deemed americas tripwire for communisms spread in the area
in may he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnams president ngo dinh diem johnson assured diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem in defeat of communism in south vietnam
during his administration kennedy continued policies that provided political and economic support and military advice and support to the south vietnamese government late in the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh kennedy slightly increased the number of military advisors and special forces us special forces in the area from in to by late but he was reluctant to order a fullscale deployment of troops before his assassination kennedy used almost exclusively military advisors and special forces in vietnam a year and onehalf later his successor president lyndon johnson committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated us involvement with forces reaching that year and in 
in late president kennedy sent roger hilsman then director of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research to assess the situation in vietnam there hilsman met sir robert thompson head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam and the concept of the strategic hamlet program was formed it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem it was implemented in early and involved some forced relocation village internment and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents it was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government by november the program waned and officially ended in 
in early kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum subversive insurgency war of liberation secretary of state dean rusk voiced strong support for us involvement operation ranch hand a largescale aerial defoliation effort began on the roadsides of south vietnamb
in april kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam we dont have a prayer of staying in vietnam those people hate us they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point but i cant give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to reelect me kennedy faced a crisis in vietnam by july despite increased us support the south vietnamese military was only marginally effective against procommunist viet cong forces
on august just as the new us ambassador henry cabot lodge jr arrived diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces funded and trained by the cia to quell buddhist demonstrations the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup dtat to remove diem with or perhaps by his brother nhu lodge was instructed to try to get diem and nhu to step down and leave the country diem would not listen to lodge
cable deptel dated august followed declaring washington would no longer tolerate nhus actions and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu if diem refused the americans would explore alternative leadership lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu as originally planned
at weeks end kennedy learned from lodge that the diem government might due to frances assistance to nhu be dealing secretly with the communistsand might ask the americans to leave orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables at the same time the first formal antivietnam war sentiment was expressed by us clergy from the ministers vietnam committee
a white house meeting in september was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the department of defense general victor krulak and the state department joseph mendenhall krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any us influence kennedy reacted saying did you two gentlemen visit the same country the president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight
in october the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d taylor to a vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from us representatives in vietnam in meetings with mcnamara taylor and lodge diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the us helping to dispel mcnamaras previous optimism about diem
taylor and mcnamara were also enlightened by vietnams vice president nguyen ngoc tho choice of many to succeed diem should a coup occur who in detailed terms obliterated taylors information that the military was succeeding in the countryside at kennedys insistence the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals by years end and complete withdrawal in something the nsc considered a strategic fantasy the final report declared that the military was making progress that the increasingly unpopular diemled government was not vulnerable to a coup and that an assassination of diem or nhu was a possibility
in late october intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot the source vietnamese general duong van minh also known as big minh wanted to know the us position kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup excluding assassination and to ensure deniability by the us later that month as the coup became imminent kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him a policy of control and cut out was initiated to insure presidential control of us responses while cutting him out of the paper trail
on november south vietnamese generals led by big minh overthrew the diem government arresting and then killing diem and nhu kennedy was shocked by the deaths he found out afterwards that minh had asked the cia field office to secure safepassage out of the country for diem and nhu but was told that hours were needed to procure a plane minh responded that he could not hold them that long
news of the coup initially led to renewed confidenceboth in america and in south vietnamthat the war might be won mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia before leaving for dallas kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year he wanted an in depth study of every possible option including how to get out of there to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top when asked what he thought the president meant forrestal said it was devils advocate stuff
historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated had kennedy survived and been reelected in fueling the debate are statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of vietnam after the election the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw a position that johnson disagreed with kennedy had signed national security action memorandum nsam dated october which ordered the withdrawal of military personnel by the end of the year such an action would have been a policy reversal but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at american university on june 
when robert kennedy was asked in what his brother would have done if the south vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat he replied wed face that when we came to it at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam us involvement in the region escalated until lyndon johnson his successor directly deployed regular us military forces for fighting the vietnam war after kennedys assassination president johnson passed nsam on november it reversed kennedys decision to withdraw troops and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese
on june kennedy delivered at the high point of his rhetorical powers the commencement address at american university in washington dc also known as strategy of peace kennedy not only outlined a plan to curb nuclear arms but also laid out a hopeful yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the us and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race the president wished to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceivedyet it is the most important topic on earth world peace i speak of peace because of the new face of warin an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn i speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational men world peace like community peace does not require that each man love his neighborit requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance our problems are manmadetherefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants the president also made two announcementsthat the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the us had postponed planned atmospheric tests
in germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east and the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer at the same time french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a francowest german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence to kennedys eyes this francogerman cooperation seemed directed against natos influence in europe
on june president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin reiterating the american commitment to germany and criticizing communism he was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience
kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner i am a citizen of berlin a million people were on the street for the speech he remarked to ted sorensen afterwards well never have another day like this one as long as we live
in kennedy stated israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom
subsequently as president kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel and he is credited as the founder of the usisraeli military alliance which would be continued under subsequent presidents kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship as he described it to golda meir between the us and israel
kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in and beginning in was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry the mim hawk as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies which were opposed by arab neighbours such as its water project on the jordan river
as result of this newly created security alliance kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials in dimona which he believed could instigate a nuclear armsrace in the middle east after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government david bengurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna when bengurion met with kennedy in new york he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being
when kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated in a may letter to bengurion that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming bengurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency iaea inspections in the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime a science attach at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited
according to seymour hersh the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance and with the full acquiescence of israel marc trachtenberg argued although well aware of what the israelis were doing kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with americas nonproliferation policy the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israels nuclear weapons program
rodger davies the director of the state departments office of near eastern affairs concluded in march that israel was developing nuclear weapons he reported that israels target date for achieving nuclear capability was on may undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year the state department argued that if israel wanted arms it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt into contracts for the supply of us weapons continued throughout 
relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd alkarim qasim on june qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait declaring the latter nation an indivisible part of iraq and causing a shortlived kuwait crisis the united kingdomwhich had just granted kuwait independence on june and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oilresponded on july by dispatching troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion at the same time kennedy dispatched a us navy task force to bahrain and the uk at the urging of the kennedy administration brought the dispute to united nations security council where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union the situation was resolved in october when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a strong arab league force
in december qasims government had passed public law which restricted the british and americanowned iraq petroleum company ipcs concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced effectively expropriating of the ipc concession us officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptiansponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state which they believed to be connected senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response qasim might grab kuwait thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production or throw himself into russian arms komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent and had the potential to get iraq back on a more neutral keel
in april the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there meanwhile kennedy instructed the central intelligence agency ciaunder the direction of archie roosevelt jrto begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim
the antiimperialist and anticommunist iraqi baath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate there was no direct american involvement although the cia was actively seeking to find a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier baathist coup plot the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a million arms deal for iraq

troubled by the longterm dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty originally conceived in adlai stevensons presidential campaign in their vienna summit meeting in june khrushchev and kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september the united states responded by conducting tests five days later shortly thereafter new us satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the ussr perceived themselves to be at parity
in july kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance
ultimately the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but not underground the us senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses

to the economic club of new york he spoke in of the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now congress passed few of kennedys major programs during his lifetime but did vote them through in under his successor johnson
kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy he presided over the first government budget to top the billion mark in and his first budget in led to the countrys first nonwar nonrecession deficit the economy which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office accelerated notably during his presidency despite low inflation and interest rates gdp had grown by an average of only per annum during the eisenhower presidency scarcely more than population growth at the time and had declined by during eisenhowers last twelve months in office

in his first state of the union address in january president kennedy said the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress including antipoverty legislation and he distanced himself from it
kennedy additionally was concerned by other issues early in his presidency such as the cold war bay of pigs fiasco and the situation in southeast asia as articulated by brother robert the administrations early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess civil rights movement participants mainly those on the front line in the south viewed kennedy as lukewarm especially concerning the freedom riders who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence including law enforcement officers both federal and state kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents robert kennedy speaking for the president urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstrucion after the civil war among conservative southern whites

in september james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering attorney general robert kennedy responded by sending federal marshals while president kennedy reluctantly sent troops after the situation on campus turned violent the ole miss riot of left two dead and dozens injured but meredith did finally enroll in his first class kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the evils of reconstruction of the s and s he had been taught or believed in were true the instigating subculture at the old miss riot and at many other racially ignited events was the ku klux klan on november kennedy signed executive order prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities

over a hundred thousand predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress and declined an invitation to speak he turned over some of the details of the governments involvement to the dept of justice which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march including the naacp and martin luther kings southern christian leadership conference sclc
to ensure a peaceful demonstration the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at pm thousands of troops were placed on standby kennedy watched kings speech on tv and was very impressed the march was considered a triumph of managed protest and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred afterwards the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken kennedy felt the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill
nevertheless the struggle was far from over three weeks later a bomb exploded on sunday september at the th street baptist church in birmingham by the end of the day four african american children had died in the explosion and two other children shot to death in the aftermath due to this resurgent violence the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill to the outrage of the president kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill without the additions had enough votes to get it out of the house committee gaining republican support senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster the legislation was enacted by kennedys successor president lyndon b johnson prompted by kennedys memory after his assassination in november enforcing voting rights public accommodations employment education and the administration of justice

the apollo program was conceived early in during the eisenhower administration as a followup to project mercury to be used as a shuttle to an earthorbital space station flights around the moon or landing on it while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo funding for the program was far from certain given eisenhowers ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight as senator kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it
in constructing his presidential administration kennedy elected to retain eisenhowers last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the presidents science advisory committee wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration having issued a report highly critical of project mercury kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e webb an experienced washington insider who served president harry s truman as budget director and undersecretary of state webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress the president and the american people kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied
in kennedys january state of the union address he had suggested international cooperation in space khrushchev declined as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities early in his presidency kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate kennedys advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost
however this quickly changed on april when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union kennedy now became eager for the us to take the lead in the space race for reasons of strategy and prestige on april he sent a memo to johnson asking him to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up after consulting with wernher von braun johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first kennedys advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing and on may kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled special message to the congress on urgent national needs
 i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish full text
after congress authorized the funding webb began reorganizing nasa increasing its staffing level and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston texas kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september in which he said
no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard full text
on november in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige and that the expense was justified johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well costs for the apollo program were expected to reach billion
in a september speech before the united nations kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space specifically recommending that apollo be switched to a joint expedition to the moon khrushchev again declined and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until on july almost six years after kennedys death apollo landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon
