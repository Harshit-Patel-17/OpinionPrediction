while in college at the ohio state university carper worked on the presidential campaign of us senator eugene mccarthy the minnesota peace candidate in delaware he worked as the campaign treasurer for university of delaware professor james r soles in his unsuccessful bid for the us house of representatives
after receiving his mba degree in carper went to work for the state of delawares economic development office in after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership he took out a personal loan to fund his campaign for the treasurer of delaware after convincing the party leaders and later the voters that he was the right person to be delaware state treasurer he defeated the favored republican party candidate theodore jones he served three terms from january through january during which time he oversaw the development of delawares first cash management system
it took a considerable amount of persuasion on the part of us senator joe biden and others to convince carper to leave his obscure but safe position as treasurer and compete for delawares only seat in the us house of representatives in thomas b evans jr the incumbent republican was running again and although he had been caught in a compromising association on a golfing trip with the young lobbyist paula parkinson he was still a formidable and wellconnected politician
the campaign was going well for carper until three weeks before election day when the new york post published an article claiming that the dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny delaware retelling the wellknown story of evans golfing trip it went on to accuse carper of abusing his wife and stepchildren but the story actually ended up working to carpers political advantage when suspicions spread that the allegations had been planted by an evans supporter and when public opinion seemed to conclude that the allegations were inappropriately exploiting a private issue
carper went on to serve five terms in the us house of representatives he won his second term in by defeating elise rw du pont the wife of former governor pierre s du pont iv he then enjoyed easy victories over republicans thomas s neuberger in james p krapf in and ralph o williams in a us representative he was a member of the us house committee on banking finance and urban affairs and the us house committee on merchant marine and fisheries he chaired the house subcommittee on economic stabilization in these positions he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean
during his years in the us house of representatives carper sought to gain better control of the democratic party organization in delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor heavily democratic and with over half of the population of the state new castle county was the key its democratic organization was controlled by eugene t reed a former ironworker and an oldtime political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices to address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the democratic party carper recruited joseph e reardon a dupont company chemist as a candidate for new castle county democratic party chairman by early he had succeeded in getting reardon elected and reardon replaced reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization in carper faced a primary challenge from a reed ally daniel d rappa but crushed him convincingly and went on to win election to his fifth term as us representative
in the small and intimate political community of delaware important decisions are often made by a consensus of leaders from both parties so it was in when popular incumbent republican governor michael castle was forced to retire owing to term limits the result was what became known as the swap castle ran for carpers seat in the us house of representatives and carper ran for governor neither faced any significant opposition and delaware retained the services of two very popular office holders representing both major parties
thus in carper was elected governor of delaware defeating the republican candidate b gary scott he ended up serving two terms as a moderate businessoriented democrat who followed two very competent and popular republican administrations those of pierre s du pont iv and castle carper chose to govern in much the same way they had over their combined years in office adding to the mix his special interest in and talent for economic development and business recruitment two particular successes were his prevention of the closure of the general motors automobile operation near newport delaware and the states victory in the competition with pennsylvania for the location of the headquarters of the pharmaceutical giant astrazeneca
continuing du ponts tax cutting policies carper led an ongoing effort to reduce income tax rates eliminate the marriage penalty and estate tax cut the public utility tax and eliminate the gross receipts tax for many small businesses by doing so his administration improved the states credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent aaa he also retained castles standardsbased education programs raising standards testing students and pushing through a teacher accountability bill other programs included a fully funded head start program and the creation of a prescriptiondrug benefit for seniors
carpers independent new democrat approach made him popular among voters but caused grumbling among old line democrats particularly union leaders who complained that not enough of them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of republican control in an era of increasingly bitter partisan politics carpers actions and policies placed him at the political center in keeping with delawares consensus style of governing
the most poignant event during this period was the murder of carpers personal scheduler anne marie fahey and the eventual conviction of thomas j capano for the crime capano was a wealthy wellconnected lawyer known to nearly everyone in delawares political community fahey an attractive yearold member of another wellknown family was attempting to end a romantic relationship with the married capano when he murdered her and dumped her body in the atlantic ocean us attorney colm f connolly built the case against capano who was tried and convicted then sentenced by delaware superior court judge william swain lee
as a tribute to fahey who had been a youth mentor thengovernor carper also became a mentor and began actively promoting mentoring programs throughout delawares business community as a result by the end of his last term delaware held the highest percapita ratio of youth mentors in the country carper also established the delaware mentoring council to help sustain this important legacy
the elections of promised to bring a change in delawares political lineup for years the same four people had held the four major statewide positionscarper and fellow democratic senator joe biden and republican us representative michael castle and senator william v roth jr because of gubernatorial term limits carper had to retire from the post he wanted to run for the senate against the incumbent roth roth would not retire voluntarily and fellow republican castle would not force him into a primary carper declared his candidacy in september and in a contest between two popular and respected politicians the issue seemed to be roths age roth was seventynine versus carpers relative youth although roth started the campaign with a to spending advantage carper went into the final month with more than million on hand carper defeated roth by almost twelve points to roth received more votes than presidential candidate george w bush however suggesting that the strength of the democratic turnout was a boon to carpers candidacy and a key factor in his victory analysts considered roths defeat was due to age especially as he collapsed at a campaign event
