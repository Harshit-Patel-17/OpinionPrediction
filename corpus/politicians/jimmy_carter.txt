the carters settled on a dirt road in nearby archery which was almost entirely populated by impoverished african american families they eventually had three more children gloria ruth and billy carter got along well with his parents although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood although earl was staunchly prosegregation he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands children an enterprising teenager carter was given his own acre of earls farmland where he grew packaged and sold peanuts he also rented out a section of tenant housing he had purchased
carter attended the plains high school from to the great depression had by then impoverished archery and plains but the family benefited from new deal farming subsidies and earl took a position as a community leader young carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading a popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod carters truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway carters teacher julia coleman was an especially strong influence as an adolescent carter played on the plains high school basketball team he also joined the future farmers of america and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking
carter had long dreamed of attending the us naval academy in annapolis he initially started undergraduate coursework in engineering at georgia southwestern college in nearby americus in transferred to georgia tech in atlanta in and achieved admission to the naval academy in he was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet in contrast to the academys culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen while at the academy carter fell in love with his sister ruths friend rosalynn smith whom he would marry shortly after his graduation in carter graduated th out of midshipmen in the class of with a bachelor of science degree and was commissioned as an ensign from to carter and rosalynn lived temporarily in virginia hawaii connecticut new york and california as he served deployments in the atlantic and pacific fleets in he began officers training for submarine duty served aboard the uss pomfret he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in in he became attached to the dieselelectric uss k aka uss barracuda qualified for command and served in several duties including executive officer
in carter began an association with the us navys fledgling nuclear submarine program led by thencaptain hyman g rickover rickovers demands on his men and machines were legendary and carter later said that next to his parents rickover was the greatest influence on his life he was sent to the naval reactors branch of the then atomic energy commission in washington dc for three month temporary duty while rosalynn moved with their children to schenectady new york on december an accident with the experimental nrx reactor at atomic energy of canadas chalk river laboratories caused a partial meltdown resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor buildings basement and leaving the reactors core ruined carter was ordered to chalk river to lead a us maintenance crew that joined other american and canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor the painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for a few minutes at a time limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor during and after his presidency carter said that his experience at chalk river had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease development of a neutron bomb after that experience carter rejoined his family to work on the ussseawolf one of the first two us nuclear submarines at the knolls atomic power laboratory which supports the us naval nuclear propulsion program in march he began nuclear power school a sixmonth noncredit course covering nuclear power plant operation at union college in schenectady and would lead to becoming an engineering officer for a nuclear power plant but in july his father died and the family business became his deciding to leave schenectady proved difficult settling after moving so much rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life returning to smalltown life in plains seemed a monumental step backward she said later on the other hand carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his fathers carter was honorably discharged from the navy on october he served in the navy reserve until and left the service with the rank of lieutenant carters awards included the american campaign medal world war ii victory medal china service medal and national defense service medal
earl carter died a relatively wealthy man having also recently been elected to the georgia house of representatives however between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs his son jimmy inherited comparatively little for a year jimmy rosalynn and their three sons lived in public housing in plains carter is the only us president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects however carter set out to expand the familys peanutgrowing business the transition from navy to agribusinessman was difficult as the harvest his first year failed due to drought carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat meanwhile he also took classes and read up on agriculture while rosalynn learned accounting to manage the businesss books though they barely broke even the first year the carters grew the business and became quite successful
racial tension was inflamed in plains by the us supreme courts antisegregation ruling in brown v board of education carter was in favor of racial tolerance and integrationat one point the local white citizens council boycotted his peanut warehouse when he refused to join thembut he often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies by he was a prominent member of the community and the baptist church as well as chairman of the sumter county school board where he began to speak more loudly in favor of school integration a state senate seat was opened by the dissolution of georgias county unit system in carter announced his run for the seat days before the election rosalynn who had an instinct for politics and organization was instrumental to his campaign the initial results showed carter losing but this was the result of fraudulent voting orchestrated by joe hurst the sheriff of quitman county carter challenged the results when fraud was confirmed a new election was held which he won
the civil rights movement was well underway as carter took office he and his family had become staunch john f kennedy supporters in the town of americus was the site of mass beatings and incarcerations of black protesters echoing similar unrest throughout the country carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first even as it polarized much of the county to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues he did speak up on a few divisive issues giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the georgia constitution which he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion a diligent legislator carter took speedreading courses to keep up with the workload within two years his connections landed him on the state democratic executive committee where he helped rewrite the state partys rules he became chairman of the west central georgia planning and development commission which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration when bo callaway was elected to the us house of representatives in november carter immediately began planning to unseat him the two had previously clashed over which twoyear college would be expanded to a fouryear college program by the state carter wanted it to go to georgia southwestern college in americus but callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown columbus carter saw callaway a republican as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics
carter was reelected in to serve a second twoyear term for a time in the state senate he chaired its education committee he also sat on the appropriations committee toward the end of his second term before his term ended he contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting georgia southwestern a fouryear program he leveraged his regional planning work giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters the last day of the term he announced his run for congress
the congressional race was shaken up in midmay when callaway dropped out and decided to run for governor of georgia instead callaway was a very strong candidate and state democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since reconstruction carter soon decided to follow callaway and run for governor himself in the democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor ellis arnall and the conservative lester maddox in a press conference he described his ideology as conservative moderate liberal and middleoftheroad i believe i am a more complicated person than that he lost the democratic primary but drew enough votes as a thirdplace candidate to force arnall into a runoff election with maddox a chain of events then resulted in maddox the dark horse candidate being elected governornote the result was a sharp blow to carter who was left deeply in debt his attempt to rescue the race from callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist maddox which he considered an even worse outcome
carter returned to his agriculture business and during the next four years carefully planned his next campaign for governor in this period was a spiritual turning point for carter he grew increasingly evangelical undertaking several religious missions in other states inspired by his sister ruth and liberal theologians such as reinhold niebuhr he declared himself born again a growing movement in s america his last child amy was born around this time
the liberal former governor carl sanders was carters main opponent in the democratic primary carter ran a more modern campaign this time around employing printed graphics and statistical analysis responding to poll data carter leaned more conservative than before he positioned himself as a populist quickly going negative against sanders for his wealth labeling him cufflinks carl and associating him with the national democratic party he accused sanders of corruption but when pressed by the media could come up with no evidence throughout the campaign carter sought both the black vote and the wallace vote after the prominent segregationist george wallace while he met with black figures such as martin luther king sr and andrew young and visited many blackowned businesses he also praised wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in georgia he implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the audience the appeal to racism became more blatant over time carters senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent sanders celebrating with black basketball players
that september carter came ahead of sanders in the first ballot by to percent leading to a runoff the campaign grew even more bitter carters campaign criticized sanders for supporting martin luther king jr carter won the runoff election with percent of the votewinning percent of the black voteand went on to win the general election easily over the republican hal suit a local news anchor once he was elected carter began to speak confidently against georgias racist politics leroy johnson a black state senator voiced his support for carter saying i understand why he ran that kind of ultraconservative campaign i dont believe you can win this state without being a racist
carter was sworn in as the th governor of georgia on january he declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial segregation was over no poor rural weak or black person should ever again have to bear the additional burden of being deprived of the opportunity for an education a job or simple justice the crowd was reportedly shocked by this message contrasting starkly with georgias political culture and particularly carters campaign the many segregationists who had supported carter during the race felt betrayed time magazine ran a story on the progressive new south governors elected that year in a may issue featuring a cover illustration of carter
lester maddox carters predecessor as governor became lieutenant governor carter had endorsed maddox although the two did not campaign as a ticket the two found little common ground during their four years of service often publicly feuding with each other richard russell jr then president pro tempore of the united states senate died in office during carters second week in office the newly inaugurated governor appointed david h gambrell state democratic party chair to fill russells unexpired term in the senate
with carters reluctance to engage in backslapping and political favors the legislature found him frustrating to work with he looked to aggressively expand the governors authority while reducing the complexity of the state government therefore he negotiated a bill allowing him to propose executive restructuring and to force a vote on it he implemented zerobased budgeting within state departments and added a judicial selection commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor the reorganization plan was submitted in january but had a cool reception in the legislature after two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session ultimately he merged about state agencies into a fact he would emphasize in his presidential runalthough it is disputed that there were any overall cost savings from doing so
civil rights were a heartfelt priority for carter he expanded the number of black state employees judges and board members he hired rita jackson samuels a black woman to advise him on potential appointments he placed portraits of martin luther king jr and two other prominent black georgians in the capitol building even as the ku klux klan picketed the unveiling ceremony still carter tried to keep his conservative allies comfortable he cosponsored an antibusing resolution with george wallace at the national governors conference after the us supreme court threw out georgias death penalty statute in furman v georgia carter signed a revised death penalty statute which addressed the courts objections thus reintroducing the practice in the state carter later regretted endorsing the death penalty saying i didnt see the injustice of it as i do now
carter pushed reforms through the legislature to provide equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of georgia set up community centers for mentally handicapped children and increased educational programs for convicts he took pride in his program for the appointment of judges and state government officials under this program all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence
in one of his more controversial decisions he vetoed a plan to build a dam on georgias flint river after surveying the river and the literature himself he argued that the us army corps of engineers was underestimating both the projects cost and its impact on the region the veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide when lieutenant william calley was convicted in a military trial and sentenced to life for his role in the my lai massacre in south vietnam a politically polarizing issue carter avoided paying direct tribute to calley he instead instituted american fighting mans day and asked georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of the military
looking toward a potential presidential run carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances he was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the democratic national convention where the liberal us senator george mcgovern was the likely presidential nominee carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative antimcgovern voters so that the convention would consider him for mcgoverns running mate on a compromise ticket he endorsed senator henry scoop jackson in part to distance himself from george wallace carter was still fairly obscure at the time and his attempt at triangulation failed the democratic ticket went to mcgovern and senator thomas eagleton
after mcgoverns loss in november carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff he had quietly decided to begin putting a presidential bid together he tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the national governors association to boost his visibility on david rockefellers endorsement he was named to the trilateral commission in april the following year he was named chairman of the democratic national committees congressional as well as gubernatorial campaigns in he appeared on the game show whats my line where a group of celebrity panelists would try to guess his occupation none recognized him and it took several rounds of questionandanswer before movie critic gene shalit correctly guessed he was a governor
when carter entered the democratic party presidential primaries in he was considered to have little chance against nationally betterknown politicians his name recognition was two percent as the watergate scandal of president nixon was still fresh in the voters minds carters position as an outsider distant from washington dc became an asset he promoted government reorganization carter published why not the best in june to help introduce himself to the american public
carter became the frontrunner early on by winning the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary he used a twoprong strategy in the south which most had tacitly conceded to alabamas george wallace carter ran as a moderate favorite son when wallace proved to be a spent force carter swept the region in the north carter appealed largely to conservative christian and rural voters he had little chance of winning a majority in most states he won several northern states by building the largest single bloc carters strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there he had traveled over miles visited states and delivered over speeches before any other candidates announced that they were in the race initially dismissed as a regional candidate carter proved to be the democrat with the most effective national strategy and he clinched the nomination
the national news media discovered and promoted carter as lawrence shoup noted in his book the carter presidency and beyond
what carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media it was their favorable coverage of carter and his campaign that gave him an edge propelling him rocketlike to the top of the opinion polls this helped carter win key primary election victories enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to presidentelect in the short space of months
