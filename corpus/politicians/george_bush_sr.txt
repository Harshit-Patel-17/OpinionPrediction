in the primary election bush focused almost entirely on the iowa caucuses while reagan ran a more traditional campaign bush represented the centrist wing in the gop whereas reagan represented conservatives bush famously labeled reagans supply sideinfluenced plans for massive tax cuts voodoo economics his strategy proved useful to some degree as he won in iowa with to reagans after the win bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum or big mo as a result of the loss reagan replaced his campaign manager reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary the two men agreed to a debate in the state organized by the nashua telegraph but paid for by the reagan campaign reagan invited the other four candidates as well but bush refused to debate them and eventually they left the debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign when the moderator john breen ordered reagans microphone turned off his angry response i am paying for this microphone struck a chord with the public bush ended up losing new hampshires primary with to reagans bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well and formally dropped out of the race in may of that year

on march early into the administration reagan was shot and seriously wounded in washington dc bush second in command by the presidential line of succession was in fort worth texas and flew back to washington immediately reagans cabinet convened in the white house situation room where they discussed various issues including the availability of the nuclear football when bushs plane landed his aides advised him to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack bush rejected the idea responding only the president lands on the south lawn this made a positive impression on reagan who recovered and returned to work within two weeks from then on the two men would have regular thursday lunches in the oval office
in december bush flew to el salvador and warned that countrys military leaders to end their death squads and hold fully free elections or face the loss of us aid bushs aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of lvaro magaa bush was never told of the aides concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of magaas personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside

reagan and bush ran for reelection in the democratic opponent walter mondale made history by choosing a woman as his running mate new york representative geraldine ferraro she and bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate serving as a contrast to the ivyleague educated bush ferraro represented a bluecollar district in queens new york this coupled with her popularity among female journalists left bush at a disadvantage the reaganbush ticket won in a landslide against the mondaleferraro ticket early into his second term as vice president bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in by the end of a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for bush
bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when on july reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon making bush acting president for approximately eight hours
the reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to iran and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunist contras in nicaragua a direct violation of the law when the irancontra affair as it became known broke to the media bush like reagan stated that he had been out of the loop and unaware of the diversion of funds although this was later questioned his diaries from that time stated im one of the few people that know fully the details ailes and others were concerned that bush was seen as a wimp an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview with dan rather

in the uss vincennes accidentally shot down iran air flight killing passengers bush said that he would never apologize for the united states of america ever i dont care what the facts are
in the january issue of time magazine in an article entitled where is the real george bush journalist robert ajemian reported that a friend of bushs had urged him to spend several days at camp david thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency to which bush is said to have responded in exasperation oh the vision thing this oftcited quote became a shorthand for the charge that bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner the phrase has since become a metonym for any politicians failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures
bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as and entered the republican primary for president of the united states in october his challengers for the republican presidential nomination included us senator bob dole of kansas us representative jack kemp of new york former governor pete dupont of delaware and conservative christian televangelist pat robertson
though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination bush came in third in the iowa caucus behind winner dole and runnerup robertson much as reagan did in bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary with dole ahead in new hampshire bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser he rebounded to win the states primary following the primary bush and dole had a joint media appearance when the interviewer asked dole if he had anything to say to bush dole said in response to the ads yeah stop lying about my record in an angry tone this is thought to have hurt doles campaign to bushs benefit bush continued seeing victory winning many southern primaries as well once the multiplestate primaries such as super tuesday began bushs organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match and the nomination was his
leading up to the republican national convention there was much speculation as to bushs choice of running mate bush chose littleknown us senator dan quayle of indiana favored by conservatives despite reagans popularity bush trailed democratic nominee michael dukakis then governor of massachusetts in most polls
bush occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to reagan delivered a wellreceived speech at the republican national convention known as the thousand points of light speech it described bushs vision of america he endorsed the pledge of allegiance prayer in schools capital punishment gun rights and opposed abortion the speech at the convention included bushs famous pledge read my lips no new taxes
the general election campaign between the two men was described in as one of the dirtiest in modern times bush blamed dukakis for polluting the boston harbor as the massachusetts governor bush also pointed out that dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the pledge of allegiance a topic well covered in bushs nomination acceptance speech
dukakiss unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates moderator bernard shaw asked dukakis if dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife kitty were raped and murdered dukakiss response of no as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon willie horton contributed toward bushs characterization of dukakis as soft on crime
bush defeated dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen in the electoral college by to bentsen received one vote from a faithless elector in the nationwide popular vote bush took of the ballots cast while dukakis received bush became the first serving vice president to be elected president since martin van buren in as well as the first person to succeed someone from his own party to the presidency via election to the office in his own right since herbert hoover in

early in his term bush faced the problem of what to do with leftover deficits spawned by the reagan years at billion in the deficit had grown to three times its size since bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit believing that america could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so he began an effort to persuade the democratic controlled congress to act on the budget with republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending and democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes bush faced problems when it came to consensus building
in the wake of a struggle with congress bush was forced by the democratic majority to raise tax revenues as a result many republicans felt betrayed because bush had promised no new taxes in his campaign perceiving a means of revenge republican congressmen defeated bushs proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by billion over five years scrambling bush accepted the democrats demands for higher taxes and more spending which alienated him from republicans and gave way to a sharp decrease in popularity bush would later say that he wished he had never signed the bill near the end of the st congress the president and congressional members reached a compromise on a budget package that increased the marginal tax rate and phased out exemptions for highincome taxpayers although he originally demanded a reduction in the capital gains tax bush relented on this issue as well this agreement with the democratic leadership in congress proved to be a turning point in the bush presidency his popularity among republicans never fully recovered
