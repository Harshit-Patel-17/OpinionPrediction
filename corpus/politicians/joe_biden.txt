negative impressions of drinking alcohol in the biden and finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to joe biden becoming a teetotaler biden suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties and overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry in front of a mirror
on august biden while still a law student married neilia hunter they overcame her parents initial reluctance for her to wed a roman catholic and the ceremony was held in a catholic church in skaneateles they had three children joseph r beau biden iii robert hunter born and naomi christina 
during biden clerked for six months at a wilmington law firm headed by prominent local republican william prickett and as he later said thought of myself as a republican he disliked the conservative racial politics of incumbent democratic governor of delaware charles l terry and supported a more liberal republican russell w peterson who defeated terry in the local republicans tried to recruit biden but he resisted due to his distaste for republican presidential candidate richard m nixon and registered as an independent instead
in biden resumed practicing law in wilmington first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by sid balick a locally active democrat balick named biden to the democratic forum a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party and biden switched his registration to democratic biden also started his own firm biden and walsh corporate law however did not appeal to him and criminal law did not pay well he supplemented his income by managing properties
later in biden ran as a democrat for the new castle county council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburban area he won by a solid twothousand vote margin in the usually republican district and in a bad year for democrats in the state even before taking his seat he was already talking about running for the us senate in a couple of years biden served on the county council from to while continuing his private law practice among issues he addressed on the council was his opposition to large highway projects that might disrupt wilmington neighborhoods including those related to interstate 
bidens entry into the us senate election in delaware presented a unique circumstance longtime delaware political figure and republican incumbent senator j caleb boggs was considering retirement which would likely have left us representative pete du pont and wilmington mayor harry g haskell jr in a divisive primary fight to avoid that us president richard m nixon helped convince boggs to run again with full party support no other democrat wanted to run against boggs bidens campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning it was managed by his sister valerie biden owens who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well and staffed by other members of his family and relied upon handedout newsprint position papers and meeting voters facetoface the small size of the state and lack of a major media market made the approach feasible biden did receive some assistance from the aflcio and democratic pollster patrick caddell bidens campaign issues focused on withdrawal from vietnam the environment civil rights mass transit more equitable taxation health care the publics dissatisfaction with politicsasusual and change during the summer biden trailed by almost percentage points but his energy level his attractive young family and his ability to connect with voters emotions gave the surging biden an advantage over the readytoretire boggs biden won the november election in an upset by a margin of votes
on december a few weeks after the election bidens wife and oneyearold daughter naomi were killed in an automobile accident while christmas shopping in hockessin delaware neilia bidens station wagon was hit by a tractortrailer as she pulled out from an intersection the truck driver was cleared of any wrongdoingnb bidens sons beau and hunter survived the accident and were taken to the hospital in fair condition beau with a broken leg and other wounds and hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries doctors soon said both would make full recoveries biden considered resigning to care for them but was persuaded not to by senate majority leader mike mansfield
biden was sworn into office on january by francis r valeo the secretary of the senate in a small chapel at the delaware division of the wilmington medical center beau was wheeled in with his leg still in traction hunter who had already been released was also there as were other members of the extended family witnesses and television cameras were also present and the event received national attention
at age the minimum age required to hold the office biden became the sixthyoungest senator in us history and one of only senators who took office before reaching the age of but the accident left him filled with both anger and religious doubt i liked to walk around seedy neighborhoods at night when i thought there was a better chance of finding a fight i had not known i was capable of such rage i felt god had played a horrible trick on me to be at home every day for his young sons biden began the practice of commuting every day by amtrak train for hours each way from his home in the wilmington suburbs to washington dc which he continued to do throughout his senate career in the aftermath of the accident he had trouble focusing on work and appeared to just go through the motions of being a senator in his memoirs biden notes that staffers were taking bets on how long he would last a single father for five years biden left standing orders that he be interrupted in the senate at any time if his sons called in remembrance of his wife and daughter biden does not work on december the anniversary of the accident
bidens elder son beau became delaware attorney general and an army judge advocate who served in iraq his younger son hunter became a washington attorney and lobbyist on may beau died at the age of after a twoyear battle with brain cancer at the time of his death beau had been widely seen as the frontrunner to be the democratic nominee for governor of delaware in 
in biden met jill tracy jacobs who grew up in willow grove pennsylvania and would become a teacher in delaware they had met on a blind date arranged by bidens brother although it turned out that biden had already noticed a photograph of her earlier in an advertisement for a local park in wilmington delaware biden would credit her with renewing his interest in both politics and life on june biden and jacobs were married by a catholic priest at the chapel at the united nations in new york jill biden has a bachelors degree from the university of delaware two masters degrees one from west chester university and one villanova university and a doctorate in education from the university of delaware they have one daughter together ashley blazer born who became a social worker and staffer at the delaware department of services for children youth and their families biden and his wife are roman catholics and regularly attend mass at st josephs on the brandywine in greenville delaware
during his first years in the senate biden focused on legislation regarding consumerprotection and environmental issues and called for greater accountability on the part of government in mid freshman senator biden was named one of the faces for the future by time magazine in a profile that mentioned what had happened to his family and characterized biden as selfconfident and compulsively ambitious
biden became ranking minority member of the us senate committee on the judiciary in in he was democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the comprehensive crime control act civil libertarians praised him for modifying some of the acts provisions and it was his most important legislative accomplishment at that point in time biden first considered running for president in that year after he gained notice for giving speeches to party audiences that simultaneously scolded and encouraged democrats
regarding foreign policy during his first decade in the senate biden focused on arms control issues in response to the refusal of the us congress to ratify the salt ii treaty signed in by soviet leader leonid brezhnev and president jimmy carter biden took the initiative to meet the soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko educated him about american concerns and interests and secured several changes to address objections of the foreign relations committee when the reagan administration wanted to interpret the salt i treaty loosely in order to allow the strategic defense initiative to proceed biden argued for strict adherence to the treatys terms biden clashed again with the reagan administration in over economic sanctions against south africa he received considerable attention when he excoriated secretary of state george p shultz at a senate hearing because of the administrations support of that country which continued to practice the apartheid system
biden ran for the democratic presidential nomination formally declaring his candidacy at the wilmington train station on june he was attempting to become the youngest president since john f kennedy when the campaign began biden was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image his speaking ability on the stump his appeal to baby boomers his high profile position as chair of the senate judiciary committee at the upcoming robert bork supreme court nomination hearings and his fundraising appeal he raised million in the first quarter of more than any other candidate
by august bidens campaign whose messaging was confused due to staff rivalries had begun to lag behind those of michael dukakis and dick gephardt although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but dukakis and was seeing an upturn in iowa polls in september the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of plagiarizing a speech that had been made earlier that year by neil kinnock leader of the british labour party kinnocks speech included the lines
why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university then pointing to his wife in the audience why is glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
while bidens speech included the lines
i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university then pointing to his wife in the audience why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because im the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that i was smarter than the rest
biden had in fact cited kinnock as the source for the formulation on previous occasions but he made no reference to the original source at the august democratic debate at the iowa state fair being reported on nor in an august interview for the national education association moreover while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other bidens use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own familys background in order to match kinnocks biden was soon found to have earlier that year lifted passages from a speech by robert f kennedy for which biden aides took the blame and a short phrase from the inaugural address of john f kennedy and in two prior years to have done the same with a passage from hubert h humphrey
a few days later bidens plagiarism incident in law school came to public light video was also released showing that when earlier questioned by a new hampshire resident about his grades in law school biden had stated that he had graduated in the top half of his class that he had attended law school on a full scholarship and that he had received three degrees in college each of which was untrue or exaggerations of his actual record
the kinnock and school revelations were magnified by the limited amount of other news about the nomination race at the time when most of the public were not yet paying attention to any of the campaigns biden thus fell into what the washington post writer paul taylor described as that years trend a trial by media ordeal biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis he withdrew from the nomination race on september saying his candidacy had been overrun by the exaggerated shadow of his past mistakes
after biden withdrew from the race it was revealed that the dukakis campaign had secretly made a video highlighting the bidenkinnock comparison and distributed it to news outlets later in the delaware supreme courts board of professional responsibility cleared biden of the law school plagiarism charges regarding his standing as a lawyer saying biden had not violated any rules
in february after suffering from several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain biden was taken by longdistance ambulance to walter reed army medical center and given lifesaving surgery to correct an intracranial berry aneurysm that had begun leaking the situation was serious enough that a priest had administered last rites at the hospital while recuperating he suffered a pulmonary embolism which represented a major complication another operation to repair a second aneurysm which had caused no symptoms but was also at risk from bursting was performed in may the hospitalization and recovery kept biden from his duties in the us senate for seven months biden has had no recurrences or effects from the aneurysms since then in retrospect bidens family came to believe that the early end to his presidential campaign had been a blessing in disguise for had he still been campaigning in the midst of the primaries in early he might well have not have stopped to seek medical attention and the condition might have become unsurvivable
biden was a longtime member of the us senate committee on the judiciary he chaired it from until and he served as ranking minority member on it from until and again from until 
while chairman biden presided over the two most contentious us supreme court confirmation hearings in history those for robert bork in and clarence thomas in in the bork hearings biden stated his opposition to bork soon after the nomination reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately at the close biden won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage as his presidential campaign collapsed in the middle of the hearings rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other bork opponents were making biden framed his discussion around the belief that the us constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text and that borks strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view borks nomination was rejected in the committee by a vote and then rejected in the full senate by a margin
in the thomas hearings bidens questions on constitutional issues were often long and convoluted sometimes such that thomas forgot the question being asked viewers of the highprofile hearings were often annoyed by bidens style thomas later wrote that despite earlier private assurances from the senator bidens questions had been akin to a beanball the nomination came out of the committee without a recommendation with biden opposed in part due to his own bad experiences in with his presidential campaign biden was reluctant to let personal matters enter into the hearings biden initially shared with committee but not the public anita hills sexual harassment charges on the grounds she was not yet willing to testify after she did biden did not permit other witnesses to testify further on her behalf such as angela wright who made a similar charge and experts on harassment biden said he was striving to preserve thomass right to privacy and the decency of the hearings the nomination was approved by a vote in the full senate with biden again opposed during and afterwards biden was strongly criticized by liberal legal groups and womens groups for having mishandled the hearings and having not done enough to support hill biden subsequently sought out women to serve on the judiciary committee and emphasized womens issues in the committees legislative agenda
biden was involved in crafting many federal crime laws he spearheaded the violent crime control and law enforcement act of also known as the biden crime law which included the federal assault weapons ban which expired in after its tenyear sunset period and was not renewed it also included the landmark violence against women act vawa which contains a broad array of measures to combat domestic violence in the supreme court ruled in united states v morrison that the section of vawa allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gendermotivated violence exceeded congresss authority and therefore was unconstitutional congress reauthorized vawa in and biden has said i consider the violence against women act the single most significant legislation that ive crafted during my year tenure in the senate in and biden enlisted major american technology companies in diagnosing the problems of the austin texasbased national domestic violence hotline and to donate equipment and expertise to it in a successful effort to improve its services
biden was critical of the actions of independent counsel kenneth starr during the s whitewater controversy and lewinsky scandal investigations and said its going to be a cold day in hell before another independent counsel is granted the same powers biden voted to acquit on both charges during the impeachment of president clinton
as chairman of the international narcotics control caucus biden wrote the laws that created the us drug czar who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy in april he introduced the controversial reducing americans vulnerability to ecstasy act also known as the rave act he continued to work to stop the spread of date rape drugs such as flunitrazepam and drugs such as ecstasy and ketamine in he worked to pass a bill outlawing steroids like androstenedione the drug used by many baseball players

biden was also a longtime member of the us senate committee on foreign relations in he became the ranking minority member and chaired the committee in january and from june through when democrats retook control of the senate following the elections biden again assumed the top spot on the committee in biden was generally a liberal internationalist in foreign policy he collaborated effectively with important republican senate figures such as richard lugar and jesse helms and sometimes went against elements of his own party biden was also cochair of the nato observer group in the senate a partial list covering this time showed biden meeting with some leaders from nearly countries and international organizations biden held frequent hearings as chair of the committee as well as holding many subcommittee hearings during the three times he chaired the subcommittee on european affairs
biden became interested in the yugoslav wars after hearing about serbian abuses during the croatian war of independence in once the bosnian war broke out biden was among the first to call for the lift and strike policy of lifting the arms embargo training bosnian muslims and supporting them with nato air strikes and investigating war crimes both the george h w bush administration and clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy fearing balkan entanglement in april biden spent a week in the balkans and held a tense threehour meeting with serbian leader slobodan miloevi biden related that he told miloevi i think youre a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one biden wrote an amendment in to compel the bush administration to arm the bosnians but deferred in to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the clinton administration before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by bob dole and joe lieberman the engagement led to a successful nato peacekeeping effort biden has called his role in affecting balkans policy in the mids his proudest moment in public life that related to foreign policy in during the kosovo war biden supported the nato bombing campaign against serbia and montenegro and cosponsored with his friend john mccain the mccainbiden kosovo resolution which called on president clinton to use all necessary force including ground troops to confront milosevic over serbian actions in kosovo in congressional quarterly named biden one of twelve who made a difference for playing a lead role in several foreign policy matters including nato enlargement and the successful passage of bills to streamline foreign affairs agencies and punish religious persecution overseas
biden had voted against authorization for the gulf war in siding with of the democratic senators he said the us was bearing almost all the burden in the antiiraq coalition biden was a strong supporter of the war in afghanistan saying whatever it takes we should do it regarding iraq biden stated in that saddam hussein was a threat to national security and that there was no option but to eliminate that threat in october biden voted in favor of the authorization for use of military force against iraq justifying the iraq war while he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a mistake he did not push to require a us withdrawal he supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized that more soldiers were needed and that the bush administration should level with the american people about the cost and length of the conflict
by late bidens stance had shifted and he opposed the troop surge of saying general david petraeus was dead flat wrong in believing the surge could work biden was instead a leading advocate for dividing iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states in november biden and leslie h gelb president emeritus of the council on foreign relations released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in iraq rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing the plan called for a third way federalizing iraq and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions in september a nonbinding resolution passed the senate endorsing such a scheme however the idea was unfamiliar had no political constituency and failed to gain traction iraqs political leadership united in denouncing the resolution as a de facto partitioning of the country and the us embassy in baghdad issued a statement distancing itself
in march biden secured the brief release of libyan democracy activist and political prisoner fathi eljahmi after meeting with leader muammar gaddafi in tripoli in may biden sharply criticized president george w bush for his speech to israels knesset in which he suggested that some democrats were acting in the same way some western leaders did when they appeased hitler in the runup to world war ii biden stated this is bullshit this is malarkey this is outrageous outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement biden later apologized for using the expletive biden further stated since when does this administration think that if you sit down you have to eliminate the word no from your vocabulary
biden was a familiar figure to his delaware constituency by virtue of his daily train commuting from there and generally sought to attend to state needs biden was a strong supporter of increased amtrak funding and rail security he hosted barbecues and an annual christmas dinner for the amtrak crews and they would sometimes hold the last train of the night a few minutes so he could catch it he earned the nickname amtrak joe as a result and in amtraks wilmington station was named the joseph r biden jr railroad station in honor of the over trips he made from there he was an advocate for delaware military installations including dover air force base and new castle air national guard base
in biden broke from liberal orthodoxy when he took legislative action to limit desegregation busing in doing so he said busing was a bankrupt idea that violated the cardinal rule of common sense and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit three years later wilmingtons federally mandated crossdistrict busing plan generated much turmoil and in trying to legislate a compromise solution biden found himself alienating both black and white voters for a while
beginning in biden served as an adjunct professor at the widener university school of law delawares only law school teaching a seminar on constitutional law the seminar was one of wideners most popular often with a waiting list for enrollment biden typically cotaught the course with another professor taking on at least half the course minutes and sometimes flying back from overseas to make one of the classes
biden was a sponsor of bankruptcy legislation during the s which was sought by mbna one of delawares largest companies and other credit card issuers biden allowed an amendment to the bill to increase the homestead exemption for homeowners declaring bankruptcy and fought for an amendment to forbid antiabortion felons from using bankruptcy to discharge fines the overall bill was vetoed by bill clinton in but then finally passed as the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act in with biden supporting it the downstate sussex county region is the nations top chickenproducing area and biden held up trade agreements with russia when that country stopped importing us chickens

biden sits on the board of advisors of the close up foundation which brings high school students to washington for interaction with legislators on capitol hill
following his initial election in biden was reelected to six additional terms in the elections of and usually getting about percent of the vote he did not face strong opposition pete du pont then governor chose not to run against him in biden spent years as a junior senator due to the twoyear seniority of his republican colleague william v roth jr after roth was defeated for reelection by tom carper in biden became delawares senior senator he then became the longestserving senator in delaware history in may biden set the mark for youngest senator to cast votes
with a net worth between and and almost no outside income or investment income biden was consistently ranked as one of the least wealthy members of the senate biden stated that he was listed as the second poorest member in congress a distinction that he was not proud of but attributed to being elected early in his career biden realized early in his senatorial career how vulnerable poorer public officials are to offers of financial contributions in exchange for policy support and he pushed campaign finance reform measures during his first term
during his years as a senator biden amassed a reputation for loquaciousness with his questions and remarks during senate hearings being especially known for being longwinded he has been a strong speaker and debater and a frequent and effective guest on the sunday morning talk shows in public appearances he is known to deviate from prepared remarks at will according to political analyst mark halperin he has shown a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and offputting things the new york times writes that bidens weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything nor is biden known for modesty journalist james traub has written that bidens vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the rarefied standards of the us senate
political writer howard fineman has said that biden is not an academic hes not a theoretical thinker hes a great street pol he comes from a long line of working people in scrantonauto salesmen car dealers people who know how to make a sale he has that great irish gift political columnist david s broder has viewed biden as having grown since he came to washington and since his failed presidential bid he responds to real peoplethats been consistent throughout and his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better traub concludes that biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself
biden ran for the democratic nomination for president in and on the national ticket as eventual nominee barack obamas runningmate
biden had thought about running for president again ever since his failed bidnb 
biden declared his candidacy for president on january after having discussed running for months prior and first made a formal announcement to tim russert on meet the press on january stating he would be the best biden i can be in january delaware newspaper columnist harry f themal wrote that biden occupies the sensible center of the democratic party themal concludes that this is the position biden desires and that in a campaign he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average american not just from the terrorist threat but from the lack of health assistance crime and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world
during his campaign biden focused on the war in iraq and his support for the implementation of the bidengelb plan to achieve political success he touted his record in the senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy despite speculation to the contrary biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of secretary of state focusing only on the presidency at a campaign event biden said i know a lot of my opponents out there say id be a great secretary of state seriously every one of them do you watch any of the debates joes right joes right joes right other candidates comments that joe is right in the democratic debates were converted into a biden campaign theme and ad in mid biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to obamas saying of the latter i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to onthejob training biden also said that obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas biden was noted for his oneliners on the campaign trail saying of republican thenfrontrunner rudy giuliani at the debate on october in philadelphia theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and overall bidens debate performances were an effective mixture of humor and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments
biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy on the day of his january announcement he spoke of fellow democratic candidate and senator barack obama i mean you got the first mainstream africanamerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy i mean thats a storybook mannb this comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fundraising capabilities it later took second place on time magazines list of top campaign gaffes for biden had earlier been criticized in july for a remark he made about his support among indian americans ive had a great relationship in delaware the largest growth in population is indianamericans moving from india you cannot go to a eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatorynb 
overall biden had difficulty raising funds struggled to draw people to his rallies and failed to gain traction against the highprofile candidacies of obama and senator hillary rodham clinton he never rose above single digits in the national polls of the democratic candidates in the initial contest on january biden placed fifth in the iowa caucuses garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates biden withdrew from the race that evening saying there is nothing sad about tonight i feel no regret
despite the lack of success bidens stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign in particular it changed the relationship between biden and obama although the two had served together on the senate foreign relations committee they had not been close with biden having resented obamas quick rise to political stardom and obama having viewed biden as garrulous and patronizing now having gotten to know each other during obama appreciated bidens campaigning style and appeal to working class voters and biden was convinced that obama was the real deal
since shortly following bidens withdrawal from the presidential race obama had been privately telling biden that he was interested in finding an important place for him in a possible obama administration biden declined obamas first request to vet him for the vice presidential slot fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his senate position but subsequently changed his mind in a june interview on nbcs meet the press biden confirmed that although he was not actively seeking a spot on the ticket he would accept the vice presidential nomination if offered in early august obama and biden met in secret to discuss a possible vicepresidential relationship and the two hit it off well personally on august barack obama announced that biden would be his running mate the new york times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone who has foreign policy and national security experienceand not to help the ticket win a swing state or to emphasize obamas change message other observers pointed out bidens appeal to middle class and bluecollar voters as well as his willingness to aggressively challenge republican nominee john mccain in a way that obama seemed uncomfortable doing at times in accepting obamas offer biden ruled out to him the possibility of running for president again in although comments by biden in subsequent years seemed to back off that stance with biden not wanting to diminish his political power by appearing uninterested in advancement biden was officially nominated for vice president on august by voice vote at the democratic national convention in denver colorado
after his selection as a vice presidential candidate biden was criticized by his own roman catholic diocese of wilmington bishop michael saltarelli over his stance on abortion which goes against the churchs prolife beliefs and teachings the diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president biden would not be allowed to speak at catholic schools biden was soon barred from receiving holy communion by the bishop of his original hometown of scranton pennsylvania because of his support for abortion rights however biden did continue to receive communion at his local delaware parish scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state catholic voters between the democratic campaign and liberal catholic groups who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion and many bishops and conservative catholics who maintained abortion was paramount biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others bishop saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to bidens no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena likewise none of us should accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
bidens vice presidential campaigning gained little media visibility as far greater press attention was focused on the republican running mate alaskan governor sarah palin during one week in september for instance the pew research centers project for excellence in journalism found that biden was only included in five percent of the news coverage of the race far less than for the other three candidates on the tickets biden nevertheless focused on campaigning in economically challenged areas of swing states and trying to win over bluecollar democrats especially those who had supported hillary rodham clinton biden attacked mccain heavily despite a longstanding personal friendshipnb he would say that guy i used to know hes gone it literally saddens me as the financial crisis of reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of september and the proposed bailout of united states financial system became a major factor in the campaign biden voted in favor of the billion emergency economic stabilization act of which passed the senate 
on october biden participated in the campaigns one vice presidential debate with palin postdebate polls found that while palin exceeded many voters expectations biden had won the debate overall on october biden suspended campaign events for a few days after the death of his motherinlaw during the final days of the campaign biden focused on lesspopulated older less welloff areas of battleground states especially in florida ohio and pennsylvania where polling indicated he was popular and where obama had not campaigned or performed well in the democratic primaries he also campaigned in some normally republican states as well as in areas with large catholic populations
under instructions from the obama campaign biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks such as one about obama being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office which had attracted negative attention privately obama was frustrated by bidens remarks saying how many times is biden gonna say something stupid obama campaign staffers referred to biden blunders as joe bombs and kept biden uninformed about strategy discussions which in turn irked biden relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month until biden apologized on a call to obama and the two built a stronger partnership publicly obama strategist david axelrod said that any unexpected comments had been outweighed by bidens high popularity ratings nationally biden had a percent favorability rating in a pew research center poll compared to palins percent
on november obama was elected president and biden vice president of the united states the obamabiden ticket won electoral college votes to mccainpalins and had a percent edge in the nationwide popular vote
biden had continued to run for his senate seat as well as for vice president as permitted by delaware lawnb on november biden was also reelected as senator defeating republican christine odonnell having won both races biden made a point of holding off his resignation from the senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on january he became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term and said in all my life the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of delaware as their united states senator biden cast his last senate vote on january supporting the release of the second billion for the troubled asset relief program biden resigned from the senate later that daynb in emotional farewell remarks on the senate floor where he had spent most of his adult life biden said every good thing i have seen happen here every bold step taken in the plus years i have been here came not from the application of pressure by interest groups but through the maturation of personal relationships
as the presidential transition of barack obama began biden said he was in daily meetings with obama and that mccain was still his friend the us secret service codename given to biden is celtic referencing his irish roots
biden chose veteran democratic lawyer and aide ron klain to be his chief of staff and time washington bureau chief jay carney to be his director of communications biden intended to eliminate some of the explicit roles assumed by the vice presidency of his predecessor dick cheney who had established himself as an autonomous power center otherwise biden said he would not model his vice presidency on any of the ones before him but instead would seek to provide advice and counsel on every critical decision obama would make biden said he had been closely involved in all the cabinet appointments that were made during the transition biden was also named to head the new white house task force on working families an initiative aimed at improving the economic well being of the middle class as his last act as chairman of the foreign relations committee biden went on a trip to iraq afghanistan and pakistan during the second week of january meeting with the leadership of those countries
biden became the th vice president of the united states on january when he was inaugurated alongside president barack obama biden is the first united states vice president from delaware and the first roman catholic to attain that office supreme court justice john paul stevens administered the oath of office to biden
in the early months of the obama administration biden assumed the role of an important behindthescenes counselor one role was to adjudicate disputes between obamas team of rivals the president compared bidens efforts to a basketball player who does a bunch of things that dont show up in the stat sheet biden played a key role in gaining senate support for several major pieces of obama legislation and was a main factor in convincing senator arlen specter to switch from the republican to the democratic party biden lost an internal debate to secretary of state hillary rodham clinton regarding his opposition to sending new troops to the war in afghanistan his skeptical voice was still considered valuable within the administration however and later in bidens views achieved more prominence within the white house as obama reconsidered his afghanistan strategy
biden made visits to iraq about once every two months including trips to baghdad in august and september to listen to prime minister nouri almaliki and reiterate us stances on iraqs future by this time he had become the administrations point man in delivering messages to iraqi leadership about expected progress in the country more generally overseeing iraq policy became bidens responsibility when the president said in joe you do iraq biden said iraq could be one of the great achievements of this administration bidens january visit to iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming iraqi parliamentary election resulted in of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the iraqi government two days later by biden had made eight trips there but his oversight of us policy in iraq receded with the exit in of us troops
biden was also in charge of the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession and stressed that only worthy projects should get funding he talked with hundreds of governors mayors and other local officials in this role during this period biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred and when he completed that role in february he said that the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent
it took some time for the cautious obama and the blunt rambling biden to work out ways of dealing with each other in late april bidens offmessage response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways led to a swift retraction from the white house the remark revived bidens reputation for gaffes and led to a spate of latenight television jokes themed on him being a loosetalking buffoon in the face of persistently rising unemployment through july biden acknowledged that the administration had misread how bad the economy was but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up the same month secretary of state clinton quickly disavowed bidens remarks disparaging russia as a power but despite any missteps biden still retained obamas confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration on march a microphone picked up biden telling the president that his signing of the patient protection and affordable care act was a big fucking deal during live national news telecasts white house press secretary robert gibbs replied via twitter and yes mr vice president youre right senior obama advisor valerie jarrett said that bidens loose talk is part of what makes the vice president so endearing we wouldnt change him one bit former senate colleague lindsey graham said if there were no gaffes thered be no joe hes someone you cant help but like biden gained a longrunning alter ego persona the president of vice on the satirical news site the onion which parodied his job title despite their different personalities obama and biden formed a friendship partly based around obamas daughter sasha and bidens granddaughter maisy who attended sidwell friends school together
bidens most important role within the administration has been to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible on june biden represented the united states at the opening ceremony of the world cup attended the england v us game which was tied and visited egypt kenya and south africa throughout joe and jill biden maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in washington often entertaining some of their grandchildren and regularly returned to their home in delaware
biden campaigned heavily for democrats in the midterm elections maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of general predictions of largescale losses for the party following largescale republican gains in the elections and the departure of white house chief of staff rahm emanuel bidens past relationships with republicans in congress became more important he led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty in december bidens advocacy within the white house for a middle ground followed by his direct negotiations with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell were instrumental in producing the administrations compromise tax package that revolved around a temporary extension of the bush tax cuts biden then took the lead in trying to sell the agreement to a reluctant democratic caucus in congress which was passed as the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 
in march obama detailed biden to lead negotiations between both houses of congress and the white house in resolving federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown by may a biden panel with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the us debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan the us debt ceiling crisis developed over the next couple of months but it was again bidens relationship with mcconnell that proved to be a key factor in breaking a deadlock and finally bringing about a bipartisan deal to resolve it in the form of the budget control act of signed on august the same day that an unprecedented us default had loomed biden had spent the most time bargaining with congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration and one republican staffer said bidens the only guy with real negotiating authority and mcconnell knows that his word is good he was a key to the deal
in october biden stated that obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the presidential election with obamas popularity on the decline however in late white house chief of staff william m daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research into the idea of secretary of state clinton replacing biden on the ticket the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for obama and white house officials later said that obama had never entertained the idea
bidens may statement that he was absolutely comfortable with samesex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to president obamas position which had been described as evolving biden made his statement without administration consent and obama and his aides were quite irked since obama had planned to shift position several months later in the buildup to the party convention and since biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key catholic voters be offended gay rights advocates seized upon the biden stance and within days obama announced that he too supported samesex marriage an action in part forced by bidens unexpected remarks biden apologized to obama in private for having spoken out while obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart the incident showed that biden still struggled at times with message discipline as time wrote everyone knows that bidens greatest strength is also his greatest weakness relations were also strained between the campaigns when biden appeared to use his to bolster fundraising contacts for a possible run on his own in the presidential election and the vice president ended up being excluded from obama campaign strategy meetings
the obama campaign nevertheless still valued biden as a retaillevel politician who could connect with disaffected blue collar workers and rural residents and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the obama reelection campaign began in earnest in spring an august remark before a mixedrace audience that proposed republican relaxation of wall street regulations would put yall back in chains led to a similar analysis of bidens facetoface campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track the los angeles times wrote most candidates give the same stump speech over and over putting reporters if not the audience to sleep but during any biden speech there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion time magazine wrote that biden often goes too far and that along with the familiar washington mix of neediness and overconfidence bidens brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness
biden was officially nominated for a second term as vice president on september by voice vote at the democratic national convention in charlotte north carolina he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone vice presidential debate on october in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administrations record and energetically attacked the republican ticket in an effort to regain campaign momentum lost by obamas unfocused debate performance against republican nominee mitt romney the week before
on november the president and vice president were elected to second terms the obamabiden ticket won electoral college votes to romneyryans and had a percent edge in the nationwide popular vote
in december biden was named by obama to head the gun violence task force created to address the causes of gun violence in the united states in the aftermath of the sandy hook elementary school shooting later that month during the final days before the country fell off the fiscal cliff bidens relationship with mcconnell once more proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the american taxpayer relief act of being passed at the start of it made permanent much of the bush tax cuts but raised rates on upper income levels
biden was inaugurated to a second term in the early morning of january at a small ceremony in his official residence with justice sonia sotomayor presiding a public ceremony took place on january he continued to be in the forefront as in the wake of the sandy hook elementary school shooting the obama administration put forth executive orders and proposed legislation towards new gun control measures the legislation failed to pass
during the discussions that led to the october passage of the continuing appropriations act which resolved the us federal government shutdown of and the us debtceiling crisis of biden played little role this was due to senate majority leader harry reid and other democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with congress feeling that biden had given too much away during previous negotiations
bidens violence against women act was reauthorized again in the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in the first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january with biden as cochair along with jarrett
as iraq fell apart during renewed attention was paid to the bidengelb iraqi federalization plan of with some observers suggesting that biden had been right all along biden himself said that the us would follow isil to the gates of hell
by a series of swearingsin and other events where biden placed his hands on women and girls and talked closely to them had attracted the attention of both the press and social media in one case a senator issued a statement afterward saying about his daughter no she doesnt think the vice president is creepy on january secret service agents heard shots were fired as a vehicle drove near bidens delaware residence at pm outside the security perimeter but the vice president and his wife jill were not home a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed
on february biden gave a speech at the th academy awards to do with awareness for sexual assault he also introduced lady gaga
almost years after two family members died in an automobile accident biden and his family were struck by a second family tragedy on may his son beau died of brain cancer at age after battling it for several years the nature and seriousness of the illness had not been previously disclosed to the public and biden had quietly reduced his public schedule in order to spend more time with his son who at the time of his death had been widely seen as the frontrunner to be the democratic nominee for governor of delaware in the vice president issued a statement saying the entire biden family is saddened beyond words
during much of his second term biden was said to be preparing for a possible bid for the democratic presidential nomination he will be on january the date on which the successful candidate will be sworn in which would have made him the oldest president on inauguration in history with his family many friends and donors encouraging him in mid to enter the race and with hillary clintons favorability ratings in decline at that time biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a draft biden pac was established
as of september biden was still uncertain whether or not to run biden cited the recent death of his son being a large drain on his emotional energy and that nobody has a right to seek that office unless theyre willing to give it of who they are
on october speaking from a podium in the rose garden with his wife and president obama by his side biden announced his decision not to enter the race for the democratic presidential nomination in the election in january biden affirmed not running was the right decision but he admitted to regretting not running for president every day 
as of the end of january neither biden nor president barack obama had endorsed any candidate for the presidential election biden did miss his annual thanksgiving tradition of going to nantucket opting instead to travel abroad and meet with several european leaders and took time to meet with martin omalley having previously met with bernie sanders neither of these meetings were considered endorsements as biden has said that he will meet with any candidate who asks
following obamas endorsement of hillary clinton on june biden also endorsed her later the same day on june biden critiqued presumptive republican nominee donald trumps proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country as well as his stated intent to build a wall between the united states and mexico border furthering that trumps suggestion to either torture and or kill family members of terrorists was both damaging to american values and deeply damaging to our security
biden has supported deficit spending on fiscal stimulus in the american recovery and reinvestment act of the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the obama administration mass transit including amtrak bus and subway subsidies samesex marriage and the reduced military spending proposed in the obama administrations fiscal year budget
a method that political scientists use for gauging ideology is to compare the annual ratings by the americans for democratic action ada with the ratings by the american conservative union acu biden has a lifetime liberal percent score from the ada through while the acu awarded biden a lifetime conservative rating of percent through using another metric biden has a lifetime average liberal score of percent according to a national journal analysis that places him ideologically among the center of senate democrats as of the almanac of american politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum in three policy areas economic social and foreign for bidens average ratings were as follows the economic rating was percent liberal and percent conservative the social rating was percent liberal and percent conservative and the foreign rating was percent liberal and percent conservative this has not changed much over time his liberal ratings in the mids were also in the percent range
various advocacy groups have given biden scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group the american civil liberties union gives him an percent lifetime score with a percent score for the th congress biden opposes drilling for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge and supports governmental funding to find new energy sources biden believes action must be taken on global warming he cosponsored the sense of the senate resolution calling on the united states to be a part of the united nations climate negotiations and the boxersanders global warming pollution reduction act the most stringent climate bill in the united states senate biden was given an percent lifetime approval rating from aflcio and he voted for the north american free trade agreement nafta
