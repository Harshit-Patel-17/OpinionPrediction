mikulski first received national attention in because of her remarks at a conference at the catholic university of america regarding ethnic americans convened by msgr geno baroni her message became one of the major documents of the ethnic movement
he has worked hard all his life to become a good american he and his sons have fought on every battlefield then he is made fun of because he likes the flag the ethnic american is overtaxed and underserved at every level of government he does not have fancy lawyers or expensive lobbyists getting him tax breaks on his income being a home owner he shoulders the rising property taxes the major revenue source for the municipalities in which he lives yet he enjoys very little from these unfair and burdensome levies
 the ethnic american also feels unappreciated for the contribution he makes to society he resents the way the working class is looked down upon in many instances he is treated like the machine he operates or the pencil he pushes he is tired of being treated like an object of production the public and private institutions have made him frustrated by their lack of response to his needs at present he feels powerless in his daily dealings with and efforts to change them unfortunately because of old prejudices and new fears anger is generated against other minority groups rather than those who have power what is needed is an alliance of white and black white collar blue collar and no collar based on mutual need interdependence and respect an alliance to develop the strategy for new kinds of community organization and political participation

as an advocate for campaign finance reform mathias refused to accept any contribution over to avoid the curse of big money that has led to so much trouble in the last year however he still managed to raise over nearly five times mikulskis total ideologically mikulski and mathias agreed on many issues such as closing tax loopholes and easing taxes on the middle class on two issues however mathias argued to reform congress and the us tax system to address inflation and corporate price fixing contrary to mikulski in retrospect the washington post felt the election was an intelligent discussion of state national and foreign affairs by two smart wellinformed people
with maryland voters mathias benefited from his frequent disagreements with the nixon administration and his liberal voting record on november he was reelected by a to margin though he lost badly in baltimore city and baltimore county where mikulski was popular it has thus far been the only election that mikulski ever lost

mathias announced his retirement before the elections at the time of this announcement it was expected that thengovernor harry hughes would be the favorite to succeed mathias however hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the maryland savings and loan crisis he lost popularity with voters opening the door for mikulskis bid for the senate the republican nominee was linda chavez who left her post as assistant to the president for public liaison in an attempt to win the seat the election was the second time in modern us history that two women faced each other in a statewide general election the race was covered by national media with observers noting that chavez was very unlikely to win
in the campaign chavez attacked mikulski a lifelong baltimore resident as a san franciscostyle george mcgovern liberal democrat chavez was accused of making mikulskis sexual orientation a central issue of the political campaign chavez wrote that the term referred to jeane kirkpatricks republican national convention blame america first speech in which she coined the phrase san francisco liberal in reference to the democratic national convention in san francisco using political advertisements and press conferences chavez attacked mikulskis former aide teresa brennan as antimale and a radical feminist implying that brennan and mikulski were radical lesbians and that fascist feminism was mikulskis political philosophy brennan had not been part of mikulskis staff for five years but chavez implied brennan was still working on mikulskis campaign mikulski did not respond in kind to the attacks she defeated chavez with of the vote she became the first female democrat elected to the us senate in her own right not appointed or filling a seat of a deceased husband mikulski was the first woman who was elected to the senate who did not have a husband or father who served in high political office she also served alongside paul sarbanes the man shed succeeded in the house
