in october newspapers reported that rubios previous statements that his parents were forced to leave cuba in after fidel castro came to power were embellishments his parents actually left cuba in during the dictatorship of fulgencio batista according to the washington post many voters in florida would be less impressed by his family being economic migrants instead of political refugees from a communist regime rubio responded saying the essence of my family story is why they came to america in the first place and why they had to stay aside from rubios maternal grandfather who fled communist cuba in several other relatives were also admitted to the us as refugees
in late a special election was called to fill the seat for the th house district in the florida house of representatives representing miami the seat had been held by representative carlos valdes who had run for and won an open florida state senate seat it was considered a safe republican seat so rubios main challenge was to win the gop nomination he campaigned as a moderate advocating tax cuts and early childhood education

at the time rubio took his seat in the legislature in tallahassee in january voters in florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on term limits this created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire according to an article in national journal rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard because he was sworn in early due to the special election and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the gop leadership
later in the majority leader of the house mike fasano promoted rubio to be one of two majority whips national journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of armtwisting but said rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them
fasano resigned in september as majority leader of the house due to disagreements with the house speaker and the speaker passed over rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for fasano rubio volunteered to work on redistricting which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions then working individually with the lawmakers involved and this work helped to cement his relationships with gop leaders
in december rubio was appointed house majority leader by speaker johnnie byrd he persuaded speaker byrd to restructure the job of majority leader so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whips office and rubio would become the main spokesperson for the house gop
according to national journal during this period rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles and some colleagues described him as a centrist who sought out democrats and groups that dont typically align with the gop he cosponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay and cosponsored a bill for giving instate tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants in the wake of the september attacks he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers and helped defeat a gop bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students

when he was chosen as future speaker in rubio delivered a speech to the house in which he asked members to look in their desks where they each found a hardcover book titled innovative ideas for floridas future but the book was intentionally blank because it had not yet been written and rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary floridians in after traveling around the state and talking with citizens and compiling their ideas rubio published the book the national journal called this book the centerpiece of rubios early speakership about of the ideas became law while another were partially enacted among the items from his book that became law were multipleyear car registrations a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses and an expanded voucherlike schoolchoice program rubios defenders and even some critics point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of rubios speakership and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult
at the time rubio took office as speaker jeb bush was completing his term as governor and bush left office in january rubio hired bush aides leading capitol insiders to say the speakers suite was the governors office in exile an article in national journal described rubios style as being very different from bushs where bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in tallahassee the article says rubios style was to delegate certain powers relinquish others and invite former political rivals into his inner circle as incoming speaker he decided to open a private dining room for legislators which he said would give members more privacy free from being pursued by lobbyists though the expense of doing so led to a public relations problem
in florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property in response to the supreme court decision in kelo v city of new london which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under eminent domain this state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by rubio prior to his speakership
jeb bushs successor as governor was charlie crist a moderate republican who took office in january rubio and crist clashed frequently their sharpest clash involved the governors initiative to expand casino gambling in florida rubio sued crist for bypassing the florida legislature in order to make a deal with the seminole tribe the florida supreme court sided with rubio and blocked the deal
rubio also was a critic of crists strategy to fight climate change through an executive order creating new automobile and utility emissions standards rubio accused crist of imposing europeanstyle big government mandates and the legislature under rubios leadership weakened the impact of crists climate change initiative rubio said that crists approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment and that a better approach would be to promote biofuel eg ethanol solar panels and energy efficiency
rubio introduced a plan to reduce state property taxes to levels and potentially eliminate them altogether while increasing sales taxes by to to fund schools the proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by billion his proposal passed the house but was opposed by governor crist and florida senate republicans who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor so rubio agreed to smaller changes and crists proposal to double the states property tax exemption from to for a tax reduction estimated by crist to be billion ultimately passed legislators called it the largest tax cut in floridas history up until then at the time republican antitax activist grover norquist described rubio as the most protaxpayer legislative leader in the country
as speaker rubio aggressively tried to push florida to the political right according to nbc news and frequently clashed with the florida senate which was run by more moderate republicans and with thengovernor charlie crist a centrist republican at the time although a conservative behind the scenes many democrats considered rubio someone with whom they could work according to biographer manuel roigfranzia dan gelber of miami the house democratic leader at the time of rubios speakership considered him a true conservative but not a reflexive partisan saying he didnt have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side to put it bluntly he wasnt a jerk gelber considered rubio a severe conservative really far to the right but probably the most talented spokesman the severe right could ever hope for
while speaker of the florida house rubio shared a residence in tallahassee with another florida state representative david rivera which the two coowned the house later went into foreclosure in after several missed mortgage payments at that point rubio assumed responsibility for the payments and the house was eventually sold
