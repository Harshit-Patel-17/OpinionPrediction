i shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little welhausen mexican school and i remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor and i think it was then that i made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any american
after teaching in houston johnson entered politics in he campaigned for texas state senator welly hopkins in his run for congress hopkins recommended him to congressman richard m kleberg who made johnson his legislative secretary johnson was elected speaker of the little congress a group of congressional aides where he cultivated congressmen newspapermen and lobbyists johnsons friends soon included aides to president franklin d roosevelt as well as fellow texans such as vice president john nance garner he also became a surrogate son to sam rayburn

in johnson successfully contested a special election for texass th congressional district that covered austin and the surrounding hill country he ran on a new deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife he served in the house from april to january president franklin d roosevelt found johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information particularly with regard to issues concerning internal politics in texas operation texas and the machinations of vice president john nance garner and speaker of the house sam rayburn johnson was immediately appointed to the naval affairs committee he worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district johnson steered the projects towards contractors that he personally knew such as the brown brothers herman and george who would finance much of johnsons future career in he ran for the us senate in a special election against the sitting governor of texas radio personality w lee pappy odaniel johnson lost the election
johnson was appointed a lieutenant commander in the us naval reserve on june while serving as a us congressman he was called to active duty three days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december his orders were to report to the office of the chief of naval operations in washington dc for instruction and training following his training he asked undersecretary of the navy james forrestal for a combat assignment he was sent instead to inspect the shipyard facilities in texas and on the west coast in the spring of president roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the southwest pacific roosevelt felt that information which flowed up the military chain of command needed to get delivered by a highly trusted political aide from a suggestion by forrestal president roosevelt assigned johnson to a threeman survey team of the southwest pacific
johnson reported to general douglas macarthur in australia johnson and two us army officers went to the nd bomb group base which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the japanese airbase at lae in new guinea johnsons roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a b bomber pilot on june johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on new guinea by eleven b bombers that included his roommate in another plane while on the mission his roommate and his crews b bomber was shot down with none of the eight men surviving the crash into the water reports vary on what happened to the b bomber carrying johnson during that mission johnsons biographer robert caro accepts johnsons account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned the aircraft was attacked disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective though remaining under heavy fire others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire this is said to be supported by official flight records other airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target at about the same time that johnsons plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase macarthur recommended johnson for the silver star for gallantry in action after it was approved by the army he personally presented the medal to johnson
johnson who had used a camera as an observer reported to roosevelt to the navy leaders and to congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable he argued that the south west pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies the warplanes sent there for example were far inferior to japanese planes and morale was bad he told forrestal that the pacific fleet had a critical need for additional experienced men johnson prepared a twelvepoint program to upgrade the effort in the region stressing greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters congress responded by making johnson chairman of a highpowered subcommittee of the naval affairs committee with a mission similar to that of the truman committee in the senate he probed the peacetime business as usual inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him johnsons biographer robert dallek concludes the mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy johnsons personal and political wishes but it also represented a genuine effort on his part however misplaced to improve the lot of americas fighting men he was released from active duty on july he was promoted to commander on october effective june he resigned from the navy reserve effective january 
johnson received the silver star american campaign medal asiaticpacific campaign medal and the world war ii victory medal
silver star citation
for gallantry in action in the vicinity of port moresby and salamaula new guinea on june while on a mission of obtaining information in the southwest pacific area lieutenant commander johnson in order to obtain personal knowledge of combat conditions volunteered as an observer on a hazardous aerial combat mission over hostile positions in new guinea as our planes neared the target area they were intercepted by eight hostile fighters when at this time the plane in which lieutenant commander johnson was an observer developed mechanical trouble and was forced to turn back alone presenting a favorable target to the enemy fighters he evidenced marked coolness in spite of the hazards involved his gallant actions enabled him to obtain and return with valuable information
in the elections johnson again ran for the senate and won in a highly controversial result in a threeway democratic party primary johnson faced a wellknown former governor coke stevenson and a third candidate johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter dubbed the johnson city windmill he raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by voting for the tafthartley act curbing union power as well as by criticizing unions stevenson came in first but lacked a majority so a runoff was held johnson campaigned even harder while stevensons efforts slumped
the runoff count took a week handled by the democratic state central committee because this was a party primary johnson was finally announced the winner by votes out of cast the committee voted to certify johnsons nomination by a majority of one with the last vote cast on johnsons behalf by temple texas publisher frank w mayborn there were many allegations of voter fraud one writer alleges that johnsons campaign manager future texas governor john b connally was connected with ballots in precinct in jim wells county where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting just at the close of polling some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day robert caro argued in his book that johnson had thus stolen the election in jim wells county and that ballots were also rigged in bexar county alone election judge luis salas said in that he had certified fraudulent ballots for johnson the state democratic convention upheld johnson stevenson went to court but johnson prevailedwith timely help from his friend abe fortas he soundly defeated republican jack porter in the general election in november and went to washington permanently dubbed landslide lyndon johnson dismissive of his critics happily adopted the nickname
once in the senate johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful courtships of older senators especially senator richard russell democrat from georgia the leader of the conservative coalition and arguably the most powerful man in the senate johnson proceeded to gain russells favor in the same way that he had courted speaker sam rayburn and gained his crucial support in the house
johnson was appointed to the senate armed services committee and later in he helped create the preparedness investigating subcommittee johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency these investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the truman administration although it can be said that the committees investigations reinforced the need for changes johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee johnson used his political influence in the senate to receive broadcast licenses from the federal communications commission in his wifes name after the general elections johnson was chosen as senate majority whip in under the new majority leader ernest mcfarland of arizona and served from to 
in the general election republicans won a majority in both the house and senate among defeated democrats that year was mcfarland who lost to upstart barry goldwater in january johnson was chosen by his fellow democrats to be the minority leader he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position one of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees while retaining it for chairmanships in the election johnson was reelected to the senate and since the democrats won the majority in the senate johnson then became majority leader former majority leader william knowland became minority leader johnsons duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the democrats johnson rayburn and president dwight d eisenhower worked well together in passing eisenhowers domestic and foreign agendacitation needed
during the suez crisis johnson tried to prevent the us government from criticizing the israeli invasion of the sinai peninsula along with the rest of the nation johnson was appalled by the threat of possible soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial earth satellite sputnik and used his influence to ensure passage of the national aeronautics and space act which established the civilian space agency nasa
historians caro and dallek consider lyndon johnson the most effective senate majority leader in history he was unusually proficient at gathering information one biographer suggests he was the greatest intelligence gatherer washington has ever known discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues his philosophy and prejudices his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote robert baker claimed that johnson would occasionally send senators on nato trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes central to johnsons control was the treatment described by two journalists
the treatment could last ten minutes or four hours it came enveloping its target at the johnson ranch swimming pool in one of johnsons offices in the senate cloakroom on the floor of the senate itselfwherever johnson might find a fellow senator within his reach
its tone could be supplication accusation cajolery exuberance scorn tears complaint and the hint of threat it was all of these together it ran the gamut of human emotions its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction interjections from the target were rare johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken he moved in close his face a scant millimeter from his target his eyes widening and narrowing his eyebrows rising and falling from his pockets poured clippings memos statistics mimicry humor and the genius of analogy made the treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless
a cigaretteperday smoker johnson suffered a nearfatal heart attack on july he abruptly gave up smoking as a result with only a couple of exceptions and did not resume the habit until he left the white house on january 
johnsons success in the senate rendered him a potential democratic presidential candidate he had been the favorite son candidate of the texas delegation at the partys national convention in and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the nomination jim rowe repeatedly urged johnson to launch a campaign in early but johnson thought it better to wait thinking that john kennedys efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited rowe finally joined the humphrey campaign in frustration another move which johnson thought played into his own strategy johnsons late entry into the campaign in july coupled with a reluctance to leave washington allowed the rival kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among democratic state party officials johnson underestimated kennedys endearing qualities of charm and intelligence as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheelingdealing landslide lyndon caro suggests that johnsons hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure
johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on kennedys youth poor health and failure to take a position regarding joseph mccarthy he had formed a stop kennedy coalition with adlai stevenson stuart symington and hubert humphrey but it proved a failure johnson received votes on the only ballot at the democratic convention which nominated john f kennedy tip oneill was a representative from kennedys home state of massachusetts at that time and he recalled that johnson approached him at the convention and said tip i know you have to support kennedy at the start but id like to have you with me on the second ballot oneill replied senator theres not going to be any second ballot
according to kennedys special counsel myer feldman and to kennedy himself it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which johnsons vicepresidential nomination ultimately took place kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional southern democrats most of whom had backed johnson nevertheless labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to johnson after much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter kennedy did offer johnson the vicepresidential nomination at the los angeles biltmore hotel at am on july the morning after he was nominated and johnson accepted from that point to the actual nomination that evening the facts are in dispute in many respects convention chairman leroy collins declaration of a twothirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed
seymour hersh stated that robert f kennedy known as bobby hated johnson for his attacks on the kennedy family and later maintained that his brother offered the position to johnson merely as a courtesy expecting him to decline arthur m schlesinger jr concurred with robert kennedys version of events and put forth that john kennedy would have preferred stuart symington as his runningmate alleging that johnson teamed with house speaker sam rayburn and pressured kennedy to favor johnson
biographer robert caro offered a different perspective he wrote that the kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close election against richard nixon and henry cabot lodge jr johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry texas and the southern states caros research showed that on july john kennedy started the process while johnson was still asleep at am john kennedy asked robert kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes including texas robert called pierre salinger and kenneth odonnell to assist him salinger realized the ramifications of counting texas votes as their own and asked him whether he was considering a kennedyjohnson ticket and robert replied yes caro contends that it was then that john kennedy called johnson to arrange a meeting he also called pennsylvania governor david l lawrence a johnson backer to request that he nominate johnson for vice president if johnson were to accept the role according to caro kennedy and johnson met and johnson said that kennedy would have trouble with kennedy supporters who were antijohnson kennedy returned to his suite to announce the kennedyjohnson ticket to his closest supporters including northern political bosses odonnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by kennedy who had previously cast johnson as antilabor and antiliberal afterward robert kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to johnson robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and johnsonapparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without john kennedys authorization
caro continues in his analysis that robert kennedy tried to get johnson to agree to be the democratic party chairman rather than vice president johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from john kennedy despite his brothers interference john kennedy was firm that johnson was who he wanted as running mate he met with staffers such as larry obrien his national campaign manager to say that johnson was to be vice president obrien recalled later that john kennedys words were wholly unexpected but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation he thought it was a stroke of genius when john and robert kennedy next saw their father joe kennedy he told them that signing johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done
at the same time as his vice presidential run johnson also sought a third term in the us senate according to robert caro on november lyndon johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the united states on the kennedyjohnson ticket and for a third term as senator he had texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices when he won the vice presidency he made arrangements to resign from the senate as he was required to do under federal law as soon as it convened on january in lloyd bentsen the vice presidential running mate of democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and also a senator from texas took advantage of lyndons law and was able to retain his seat in the senate despite dukakis loss to george h w bush
johnson was reelected senator with votes percent to republican john towers percent fellow democrat william a blakley was appointed to replace johnson as senator but blakley lost a special election in may to tower
after the election johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position he initially sought a transfer of the authority of senate majority leader to the vice presidency since that office made him president of the senate but faced vehement opposition from the democratic caucus including members whom he had counted as his supporters
johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch he drafted an executive order for kennedys signature granting johnson general supervision over matters of national security and requiring all government agencies to cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments kennedys response was to sign a nonbinding letter requesting johnson to review national security policies instead kennedy similarly turned down early requests from johnson to be given an office adjacent to the oval office and to employ a fulltime vice presidential staff within the white house his lack of influence was thrown into relief later in when kennedy appointed johnsons friend sarah t hughes to a federal judgeship whereas johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency house speaker sam rayburn wrangled the appointment from kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill
moreover many members of the kennedy white house were contemptuous of johnson including the presidents brother attorney general robert f kennedy and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque crude manner congressman tip oneill recalled that the kennedy men had a disdain for johnson that they didnt even try to hidethey actually took pride in snubbing him
kennedy however made efforts to keep johnson busy informed and at the white house often telling aides i cant afford to have my vice president who knows every reporter in washington going around saying were all screwed up so were going to keep him happy kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities through which he worked with african americans and other minorities kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position but taylor branch in pillar of fire contends that johnson pushed the kennedy administrations actions further and faster for civil rights than kennedy originally intended to go branch notes the irony of johnson being the advocate for civil rights when the kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters in particular he notes johnsons memorial day speech at gettysburg pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action
johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions which gave him limited insights into global issues as well as opportunities at selfpromotion in the name of showing the countrys flag he attended cabinet and national security council meetings kennedy gave johnson control over all presidential appointments involving texas and appointed him chairman of the presidents ad hoc committee for science
kennedy also appointed johnson chairman of the national aeronautics space council the soviets beat the us with the first manned spaceflight in april and kennedy gave johnson the task of evaluating the state of the us space program and recommending a project that would allow the us to catch up or beat the soviets johnson responded with a recommendation that the us gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an american on the moon in the s kennedy assigned priority to the space program but johnsons appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure
johnson was touched by a senate scandal in august when bobby baker the secretary to the majority leader of the senate and a protg of johnsons came under investigation by the senate rules committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance one witness alleged that baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the vice president baker resigned in october and the investigation did not expand to johnson the negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in washington circles that kennedy was planning on dropping johnson from the democratic ticket in the upcoming presidential election however on october a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have johnson on the ticket the following year kennedy replied yes to both those questions there is little doubt that robert kennedy and johnson hated each other yet john and robert kennedy agreed that dropping johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the south in the election and they agreed that johnson would stay on the ticket
johnsons presidency took place during a healthy economy with steady growth and low unemployment regarding the rest of the world there were no serious controversies with major countries attention therefore focused on domestic policy and after on the vietnam war
johnson was quickly sworn in as president on the air force one plane in dallas on november just hours and minutes after john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas amid suspicions of a conspiracy against the government he was sworn in by us district judge sarah t hughes a family friend in the rush a bible was not at hand so johnson took the oath of office using a roman catholic missal from president kennedys desk cecil stoughtons iconic photograph of johnson taking the presidential oath of office as mrs kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft
he was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock he and the secret service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from dallas and return him to washington this was greeted by some with assertions that johnson was in too much haste to assume power
in the days following the assassination lyndon b johnson made an address to congress saying that no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long the wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to johnsons promise to carry out kennedys plans and his policy of seizing kennedys legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda
on november just one week after kennedys assassination johnson issued an executive order to rename nasas apollo launch operations center and the nasaair force cape canaveral launch facilities as the john f kennedy space center cape canaveral was officially known as cape kennedy from 
johnson was alert to the public demand for answers to head off snowballing speculation about such conspiracies he immediately created a panel headed by chief justice earl warren known as the warren commission to investigate kennedys assassination the commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the assassination conspiracy theorists were not satisfied and they kept active for decades
johnson retained senior kennedy appointees some for the full term of his presidency he even retained robert kennedy as attorney general with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship robert kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in to run for the senate although johnson had no official chief of staff walter jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the white house george reedy who was johnsons secondlongestserving aide assumed the post of press secretary when john f kennedys own pierre salinger left that post in march horace busby was another triplethreat man as johnson referred to his aides he served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst bill moyers was the youngest member of johnsons staff he handled scheduling and speechwriting parttime
the new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of kennedys primary legislative goalsa tax cut johnson worked closely with harry f byrd of virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below billion in exchange for what became overwhelming senate approval of the revenue act of congressional approval followed at the end of february and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights in late johnson also launched the initial offensive of his war on poverty recruiting kennedy relative sargent shriver then head of the peace corps to spearhead the effort in march lbj sent to congress the economic opportunity act which created the job corps and the community action program designed to attack poverty locally the act also created vista volunteers in service to america a domestic counterpart to the peace corps
president kennedy had submitted a civilrights bill to congress in june which was met with strong opposition johnson renewed the effort and asked bobby kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on capitol hill this provided adequate political cover for johnson should the effort fail but if it were successful johnson would receive ample credit historian robert caro notes that the bill kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote in particular they held up all of the major bills kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent especially the tax reform bill in order to force the bills supporters to pull it
johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic as he played a role in a similar tactic against the civil rights bill that harry truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier in that fight a rentcontrol renewal bill was held up until the civilrights bill was withdrawn believing that the current course meant that the civil rights act would suffer the same fate he adopted a different strategy from that of kennedy who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process by tackling the tax cut first the previous tactic was eliminated
passing the civil rights bill in the house required getting it through the rules committee which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed the house rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full house which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of in the senate since the tax bill had passed three days earlier the anticivilrights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty republicans who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill according to caro it was ultimately johnsons ability to convince republican leader everett dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary republican votes to overcome the filibuster in march after hours of debate the bill passed the senate by a vote of johnson signed the fortified civil rights act of into law on july legend has it that as he put down his pen johnson told an aide we have lost the south for a generation anticipating a coming backlash from southern whites against johnsons democratic party
biographer randall b woods has argued that johnson effectively used appeals to judeochristian ethics to garner support for the civil rights law woods writes that johnson undermined the southern filibuster against the bill
lbj wrapped white america in a moral straight jacket how could individuals who fervently continuously and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just god continue to condone racial discrimination police brutality and segregation where in the judeochristian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in alabama denying an equal education to black children barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families was jim crow to be americas response to godless communism 
woods states that johnsons religiosity ran deep at he joined the disciples of christ or christian church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor the strong to assist the weak and the educated to speak for the inarticulate johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor fdr in that he paired liberal values to religious values believing that freedom and social justice served both god and man
johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for eric goldman who joined the white house in december of that year thought johnsons domestic program was best captured in the title of walter lippmans book the good society richard goodwin tweaked itto the great society and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for johnson in may at the university of michigan it encompassed movements of urban renewal modern transportation clean environment antipoverty healthcare reform crime control and educational reform
in august allegations arose from the military that two us destroyers had been attacked by some north vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters miles km from the vietnamese coast in the gulf of tonkin naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory although johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about vietnam out of the election campaign he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the vietnamese so he sought and obtained from the congress the gulf of tonkin resolution on august johnson determined to embolden his image on foreign policy also wanted to prevent criticism such as truman had received in korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action a response to the purported attack as well blunted presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish goldwater camp the resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commanderinchief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of seato requesting assistance johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary us goal remained the preservation of south vietnamese independence through material and advice as opposed to any us offensive posture the publics reaction to the resolution at the time was positive percent favored stronger measures in vietnam and only percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave
in spring johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right a pivotal change took place in april when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike after considerable horse trading especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the irs johnson got an agreement this substantially boosted his selfconfidence as well as his image
that same year robert f kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as johnsons vice presidential running mate but johnson and kennedy however had never liked one another and johnson afraid that kennedy would be credited with his election as president abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn kennedy was himself undecided about the position and knowing that the prospect rankled johnson was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration ultimately goldwaters poor polling numbers degraded any dependence johnson might have had on kennedy as his running mate hubert humphreys selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen johnson in the midwest and industrial northeast johnson knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president put humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage
in preparation for the democratic convention johnson requested the fbi send a squad of agents to cover convention activities the objective of the squad was to inform the white house staff of any disruptive activities on the floor the squads focus narrowed upon the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp delegation which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state the squads activities also included wiretaps of martin luther kings room as well as the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core from beginning to end the squads assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other highranking officials
in fact johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the mfdp and the segregationist delegation and he assigned humphrey the job of managing the problem the conventions credentials committee declared that two mfdp delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color the mfdp rejected the committees ruling the convention became the apparent personal triumph that johnson craved but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the mfdp would trigger disaffection with johnson and the democratic party from the left sncc chairman john lewis would call it a turning point in the civil rights movement
early in the presidential campaign barry goldwater appeared to be a strong contender with strong support from the south which threatened johnsons position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the civil rights act however goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed on september johnsons campaign managers broadcast the daisy ad it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy counting up to ten then a baritone voice took over counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb the message conveyed was that electing goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war goldwaters campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming in your heart you know hes right opponents captured the spirit of johnsons campaign with bumper stickers that said in your heart you know he might and in your gut you know hes nuts johnson won the presidency by a landslide with percent of the vote making it the highest ever share of the popular vote at the time this was also the widest popular margin in the th centurymore than million votesthis was later surpassed by incumbent president nixons victory in in the electoral college johnson defeated goldwater by margin of to johnson won states compared to goldwaters six voters also gave johnson the largest majorities in congress since fdrs election in a senate with a majority and a house with a democratic margin
johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office ready to carry forward the plans and programs of john fitzgerald kennedy not because of our sorrow or sympathy but because they are right he was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the civil rights act of and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out nevertheless the selma to montgomery marches in alabama led by martin luther king ultimately led johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in february 
johnson gave a congressional speechdallek considers it his greatestin which he said rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itselfrarely are we met with the challenge to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation in he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the voting rights act which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time in accordance with the act several states seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy alabama south carolina north carolina georgia louisiana mississippi virginia were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in while texas home to the majority of the african american population at the time followed in the senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of just after months and won passage in the house in july by the results were significantbetween the years of and the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled the act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationallyin a few hundred black officeholders mushroomed to in 
after the murder of civil rights worker viola liuzzo johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four ku klux klansmen implicated in her death he angrily denounced the klan as a hooded society of bigots and warned them to return to a decent society before its too late johnson was the first president to arrest and prosecute members of the klan since ulysses s grant about years earlier he turned to themes of christian redemption to push for civil rights thereby mobilizing support from churches north and south at the howard university commencement address on june he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals to shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin to dissolve as best we can the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder divide the great democracy and do wronggreat wrongto the children of god
in johnson nominated civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to be the first african american associate justice of the supreme court to head the new department of housing and urban development johnson appointed robert c weaverthe first africanamerican cabinet secretary in any us presidential administration in johnson signed the civil rights act of which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race creed or national origin the impetus for the laws passage came from the chicago open housing movement the april assassination of martin luther kingjr and the civil unrest across the country following kings death on april johnson wrote a letter to the united states house of representatives urging passage of the fair housing act with newly urgent attention from legislative director joseph califano and democratic speaker of the house john mccormack the bill which was previously stalled passed the house by a wide margin on april 
with the passage of the sweeping immigration and nationality act of the countrys immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the s were removed the annual rate of inflow doubled between and and doubled again by with dramatic increases from asia and mexico scholars give johnson little credit for the law which was not one of his priorities he had supported the mccarrenwalters act of that was unpopular with reformers
johnson whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in texas fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty and was an essential component of the american dream especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tightfisted budgets from local taxes he made education the top priority of the great society agenda with an emphasis on helping poor children after the landslide brought in many new liberal congressmen lbj launched a legislative effort which took the name of the elementary and secondary education act esea of the bill sought to double federal spending on education from billion to billion with considerable facilitating by the white house it passed the house by a vote of to on march and then it remarkably passed without change in the senate by to without going through the usual conference committee this was an historic accomplishment by the president with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just days before
for the first time large amounts of federal money went to public schools in practice esea meant helping all public school districts with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families which included all the big cities for the first time private schools most of them catholic schools in the inner cities received services such as library funding comprising about percent of the esea budget though federal funds were involved they were administered by local officials and by it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line dallek further reports that researchers cited by hugh davis graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by esea reading and math programs but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes johnsons second major education program was the higher education act of which focused on funding for lower income students including grants workstudy money and government loans
he set up the national endowment for the humanities and the national endowment for the arts to support humanists and artists as the wpa once did although esea solidified johnsons support among k teachers unions neither the higher education act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in vietnam in johnson signed the public broadcasting act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks
in at johnsons request congress passed the revenue act of and the economic opportunity act as part of the war on poverty johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as head start food stamps and work study during johnsons years in office national poverty declined significantly with the percentage of americans living below the poverty line dropping from percent to percent
johnson took an additional step in the war on poverty with an urban renewal effort presenting to congress in january the demonstration cities program to be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city johnson requested an investment of million per year totaling billion in the fall of the congress passed a substantially reduced program costing million which johnson later called the model cities program changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill the new york times wrote years later that the program was for the most part a failure
johnsons initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of the commission on heart disease cancer and strokes hdcs combined these diseases accounted for percent of the nations deaths in to enact recommendations of the commission johnson asked congress for funds to set up the regional medical program rmp to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice congress passed a significantly watered down version
as a backup position in johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under social security the key player in initiating this program named medicare was wilbur mills chairman of the house ways and means committee in order to reduce republican opposition mills suggested that medicare be fashioned as a three layer cakehospital insurance under social security a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor known as medicaid the bill passed the house by a margin of votes on april the effort in the senate was considerably more complicated however the medicare bill passed congress on july after negotiation in a conference committee medicare now covers tens of millions of americans johnson gave the first two medicare cards to former president harry s truman and his wife bess after signing the medicare bill at the truman library in independence missouri
in march johnson sent to congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new transportation departmentwhich would include the commerce departments office of transportation the bureau of public roads the federal aviation agency the coast guard the maritime administration the civil aeronautics board and the interstate commerce commission the bill passed the senate after some negotiation over navigation projects in the house passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed october 
on october lyndon johnson signed the gun control act of one of the largest and farthestreaching federal gun control laws in american history much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of john f kennedy robert f kennedy and martin luther king jr
during johnsons administration nasa conducted the gemini manned space program developed the saturn v rocket and its launch facility and prepared to make the first manned apollo program flights on january the nation was stunned when the entire crew of apollo was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad stopping apollo in its tracks rather than appointing another warrenstyle commission johnson accepted administrator james e webbs request for nasa to do its own investigation holding itself accountable to congress and the president johnson maintained his staunch support of apollo through congressional and press controversy and the program recovered the first two manned missions apollo and the first manned flight to the moon apollo were completed by the end of johnsons term he congratulated the apollo crew saying youve taken all of us all over the world into a new era on july johnson attended the launch of the first moon landing mission apollo becoming the first former or incumbent us president to witness a rocket launch
major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of long hot summers they started with a violent disturbance in the harlem riots in and the watts district of los angeles in and extended to the momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of with the riots in watts after people were killed and million in property was damaged the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities and so the appetite for additional programs in lbjs agenda was lost
the biggest wave of riots came in april in over a hundred cities after the assassination of martin luther king newark burned in where six days of rioting left dead injured and the inner city a burned out shell in detroit in governor george romney sent in national guard troops to quell fire bombings looting and attacks on businesses and on police johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally were dead were injured were arrested property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing but this fell on deaf ears johnsons popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape reinforcing the sense johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party johnson created the kerner commission to study the problem of urban riots headed by illinois governor otto kerner according to press secretary george christian johnson was unsurprised by the riots saying what did you expect i dont know why were so surprised when you put your foot on a mans neck and hold him down for three hundred years and then you let him up whats he going to do hes going to knock your block off
in the press sensed a credibility gap between what johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in vietnam which led to much less favorable coverage
by years end the democratic governor of missouri warren e hearnes warned that johnson would lose the state by votes despite winning by a margin in frustration over vietnam too much federal spending and taxation no great public support for your great society programs and public disenchantment with the civil rights programs had eroded the presidents standing the governor reported there were bright spots in january johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history unemployment was at a year low and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever a percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome as was the rise in interest rates johnson asked for a temporary percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending johnsons approval ratings stayed below percent by january the number of his strong supporters had plunged to from percent four months before he ran about even with republican george romney in trial matchups that spring asked to explain why he was unpopular johnson responded i am a dominating personality and when i get things done i dont always please all the people johnson also blamed the press saying they showed complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to he also blamed the preachers liberals and professors who had turned against him in the congressional elections of the republicans gained three seats in the senate and in the house reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for johnson to pass any additional great society legislation however in the end congress passed almost percent of the administrations great society programs which johnson then signed into law
johnson subscribed to the domino theory in vietnam and to a containment policy that required america to make a serious effort to stop all communist expansion at kennedys death there were american military personnel in vietnam johnson immediately reversed kennedys order to withdraw military personnel by the end of he expanded the numbers and roles of the american military following the gulf of tonkin incident soon after the republican convention of 
johnson in late summer seriously questioned the value of staying in vietnam but after meeting with secretary of state dean rusk and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff maxwell d taylor declared his readiness to do more when we had a base or when saigon was politically more stable in the presidential campaign he restated his determination to provide measured support for vietnam while avoiding another korea but privately he had a sense of foreboding about vietnama feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly indeed his heart was on his great society agenda and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his war on poverty the situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional viet minh attacks on us ships in the tonkin gulf as well as an attack on bien hoa airbase in south vietnam johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the joint chiefs and also after public pollster lou harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls by the end of there were approximately military personnel in south vietnam us casualties for totaled 
in the winter of johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in south vietnam moreover a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists with only to percent opposed johnson revised his priorities and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of january with yet another change of government in saigon he then agreed with mac bundy and mcnamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation johnson said stable government or no stable government in saigon we will do what we ought to do im prepared to do that we will move strongly general nguyn khnh head of the new government is our boy
johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in february after a ground report from bundy recommending immediate us action to avoid defeat also the viet cong had just killed eight us advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at pleiku air base the eightweek bombing campaign became known as operation rolling thunder johnsons instructions for public consumption were clearthere was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that hanoi would rein in the viet cong to one of provoking hanoi and the viet cong into an intensification of the war but the shortterm expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the south vietnamese government would be bolstered by limiting the information given out to the public and even to congress johnson maximized his flexibility to change course
in march bundy began to urge the use of ground forcesamerican air operations alone he counseled would not stop hanois aggression against the south johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of to the deployment of two additional marine battalions and a marine air squadron in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisionsand most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations nevertheless he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy
in early johnson sent us marines to the dominican republic to protect the embassy there and to respond to yet another perceived communist threat by the escalating civil war that spring an agreement was reached at the urging of the oas and the us to end the uprising this crisis reinforced johnsons belief it was essential to convince supporters and opponents at home and abroad that he had an effective strategy to meet the communist challenge in vietnam
after a conference of advisors in honolulu in april by the middle of june the total us ground forces in vietnam were increased to or by percent on may johnson told congressional leaders that he wanted an additional million for vietnam and the dominican republic saying each member of congress who supports this request is voting to continue our effort to try to hold communist aggression the request was approved by the house to and by the senate to in june ambassador taylor reported that the bombing offensive against north vietnam had been ineffective and that the south vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse gen westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from to after consulting with his principals johnson desirous of a low profile chose to announce at a press conference an increase to troops with additional forces to be sent later upon request in order to mute his announcement johnson at the same time announced the nomination of abe fortas to the supreme court and john chancellor as director of the voice of america johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choicesbetween sending americans to die in vietnam and giving in to the communists if he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached he continued to insist that his decision did not imply any change in policy whatsoever of his desire to veil the decision johnson jested privately if you have a motherinlaw with only one eye and she has it in the center of her forehead you dont keep her in the living room by october there were over troops deployed in vietnam
polls showed that beginning in the public was consistently percent hawkish and percent dovish johnsons aides told him both hawks and doves are frustrated with the war and take it out on you politically johnson closely watched the public opinion polls his goal was not to adjust his policies to follow opinion but rather to adjust opinion to support his policies until the tet offensive of he systematically downplayed the war he made very few speeches about vietnam and held no rallies or parades or advertising campaigns he feared that publicity would charge up the hawks who wanted victory and weaken both his containment policy and his higher priorities in domestic issues jacobs and shapiro conclude although johnson held a core of support for his position the president was unable to move americans who held hawkish and dovish positions
on april the current canadian prime minister lester b pearson gave a speech at temple university in philadelphia during his speech he voiced his support for a pause in the american bombing of north vietnam so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold to president johnson this criticism of american foreign policy on american soil was an intolerable sin before pearson had finished his speech he was summoned to camp david maryland to meet with johnson the next day johnson who was notorious for his personal touch in politics reportedly grabbed pearson by the lapels and shouted dont you come into my living room and piss on my rug
at the end of after consultation with the joint chiefs and other advisers johnson decided to increase troops at the rate of per month throughout rather than increasing them at one time in order to avoid a more publicized increase at the same time there was deliberation over a bombing pause and johnson finally agreed on december to a pause and a corresponding peace offensive the pause in bombing and the peace blitz ended january without discernible effect disturbed by criticism of the war then underscored with public hearings by the senate foreign relations committee in january johnson convened a second honolulu conference and personally attended for three days along with ambassador lodge gen westmoreland the vietnamese chief of state nguyen van thieu and prime minister nguyen cao ky in april johnson was encouraged by statistics that the viet cong had suffered greater numbers of casualties than the south vietnamese at the same time despite urgings in honolulu to strengthen his internal affairs prime minister kys administration was increasingly vulnerable to rebel forces the administration pressured ky to hasten a transfer of power to an assembly but he demurred
public as well as political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of at the time when johnsons approval ratings were reaching new lows of percent sen richard russell chairman of the armed services committee reflected the national mood in june when he declared it was time to get it over or get out johnson responded by saying to the press we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost in response to the intensified criticism of the war effort johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country and press relations became strained johnsons primary war policy opponent in congress included among others the chairman of the foreign relations committee james william fulbright the persistent johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum oil and lubrication facilities in north vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory humphrey rusk and mcnamara all agreed the bombing began the end of june in july polling results indicated that americans favored the bombing campaign by a to margin however in august a defense department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on north vietnam
in the fall of however multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the north vietnamese logistics and infrastructure johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions there was no shortage of peace initiatives nevertheless among protesters english philosopher bertrand russell attacked johnsons policy as a barbaric aggressive war of conquest and in june he initiated the international war crimes tribunal as a means to condemn the american effort the gap with hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces in august johnson appointed averell harriman ambassador for peace to promote negotiations westmoreland and mcnamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification johnson formally placed this effort under military control in october also in october to reassure and promote his war effort johnson initiated a meeting with allies in manilathe south vietnamese thais south koreans filipinos australians and new zealanders the conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in vietnam and across asia for johnson it was a fleeting public relations successconfirmed by a percent vietnam approval rating in november nevertheless in december johnsons vietnam approval rating was again back down in the s lbj had become anxious to justify war casualties and talked of the need for decisive victory despite the unpopularity of the cause in a discussion about the war with former president dwight eisenhower on october johnson said he was trying to win it just as fast as i can in every way that i know how and later stated that he needed all the help i can get
by years end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual as had been the air campaign johnson then agreed to mcnamaras new recommendation to add troops in to the previously committed while mcnamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing johnson agreed with cia recommendations to increase them the increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in saigon hanoi and warsaw while the bombing ended the talks north vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine
january and february included probes to detect north vietnamese willingness to discuss peace and all fell on deaf ears ho chi minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the us corrected military estimates released in march indicated a greater number of enemyinitiated actions between february and this exemplified the unreliability of information coming from the ground in vietnam similar discrepancies existed in measuring the movement of supplies and forces from north to south and assessing viet cong manpower in february johnson nevertheless agreed to attacks on infiltration routes in laos and fiftyfour new targets in the north as well as the mining of inland waterways to complement bombing
in march robert kennedy assumed a more public opposition to the war in a senate speech the fact of his opposition and probable candidacy for the presidency in according to dallek inhibited the embattled and embittered johnson from employing a more realistic war policy johnsons anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to kennedy johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer and warned kennedy ill destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months he shouted youll be dead politically in six months in june a decisive of the country said they had lost confidence in the presidents leadership mcnamara actually offered johnson a way out of vietnam in may the administration could declare its objective in the warsouth vietnams selfdeterminationwas being achieved and upcoming september elections in south vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government the united states could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome but johnson was reluctant in light of some optimistic reports again of questionable reliability which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement the cia was reporting wide food shortages in hanoi and an unstable power grid as well as military manpower reductions
by the middle of nearly americans had been killed or wounded in the war in july johnson sent mcnamara wheeler and other officials to meet with westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future at that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a stalemate westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction and that we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes though westmoreland sought many more johnson agreed to an increase of troops bringing the total to a gallup poll in july showed percent of the country disapproving of the presidents handling of the war and only percent thought progress was being made
in august johnson with the joint chiefs support decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only hanoi haiphong and a buffer zone with china from the target list later that month mcnamara told a senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring hanoi to the peace tablethe joint chiefs were astounded and threatened mass resignationmcnamara was summoned to the white house for a threehour dressing down nevertheless johnson had received reports from the cia confirming mcnamaras analysis at least in part in the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the south was concluded and provided hope for peace talks
despite the election the south vietnam government remained incompetent and riddled with corruption but in september ho chi minh and north vietnamese premier pham van dong appeared amenable to french mediation so johnson ceased bombing in a mile zone around hanoi this was met with dissatisfaction johnson in a texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if ho chi minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if north vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt this was named the san antonio formula there was no response but johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause
fellow democrat tip oneill joined the ranks of those opposed to the war in late and with the ever increasing public protests against the war in october johnson engaged the fbi and the cia to investigate monitor and undermine antiwar activists in midoctober there was a demonstration of at the pentagon johnson and rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration which was refuted by cia findings
with the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict johnson convened a group called the wise men for a fresh indepth look at the wardean acheson gen omar bradley george ball mac bundy arthur dean douglas dillon abe fortas averell harriman henry cabot lodge robert murphy and max taylor at that time mcnamara reversing his position on the war recommended that a cap of be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted since he could see no success johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and described mcnamara as ready to pull another forrestal a reference to the suicide of former defense secretary james forrestal mcnamaras resignation soon followed
with the exception of george ball the wise men all agreed the administration should press forward johnson was confident that hanoi would await the us election results before deciding to negotiate
as casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever johnsons popularity plummeted college students and others protested burned draft cards and chanted hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests and was not allowed by the secret service to attend the democratic national convention where thousands of hippies yippies black panthers and other opponents of johnsons policies both in vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest thus by the public was polarized with the hawks rejecting johnsons refusal to continue the war indefinitely and the doves rejecting his current war policies support for johnsons middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement by late summer he realized that nixon was closer to his position than humphrey he continued to support humphrey publicly in the election and personally despised nixon one of johnsons well known quotes was the democratic party at its worst is still better than the republican party at its best
on january came the viet cong and north vietnamese tet offensive against south vietnams five largest cities including saigon and the us embassy there and other government installations while the tet offensive failed militarily it was a psychological victory definitively turning american public opinion against the war effort iconically walter cronkite of cbs news voted the nations most trusted person in february expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing johnson reacted saying if ive lost cronkite ive lost middle america indeed demoralization about the war was everywhere then approved of johnsons handling of vietnam disapproved johnson agreed to increase the troop level by despite a recommendation from the joint chiefs for ten times that number by march johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war clark clifford the new defense secretary described the war as a loser and proposed to cut losses and get out on march johnson spoke to the nation of steps to limit the war in vietnam he then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of north vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time at the close of his speech he also announced i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president
in march johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that percent of north vietnams population and percent of its territory was offlimits to bombing in april he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site paris was agreed to and talks began in may when the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in paris two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive despite recommendations in august from harriman vance clifford and bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks johnson refused in october when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt republican presidential nominee richard nixon intervened with the south vietnamese and made promises of better terms so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election after the election johnsons primary focus on vietnam was to get saigon to join the paris peace talks ironically only after nixon added his urging did they do so even then they argued about procedural matters until after nixon took office
a few analysts have theorized that vietnam had no independent impact on president johnsons popularity at all after other effects including a general overall downward trend in popularity had been taken into account the war grew less popular and continued to split the democratic party the republican party was not completely pro or antiwar and nixon managed to get support from both groups by running on a reduction in troop levels with an eye toward eventually ending the campaign
johnson often privately cursed the vietnam war and in a conversation with robert mcnamara he assailed the bunch of commies running the new york times for their articles against the war effort in two weeks in may alone american deaths numbered with total casualties at alluding to the domino theory he said if we allow vietnam to fall tomorrow well be fighting in hawaii and next week in san franciscocitation needed
johnson once summed up his perspective of the vietnam war as follows
i knew from the start that i was bound to be crucified either way i moved if i left the woman i really lovedthe great societyin order to get involved in that bitch of a war on the other side of the world then i would lose everything at home all my programs but if i left that war and let the communists take over south vietnam then i would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser and we would both find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere on the entire globe
biographers including dallek have said that johnson suffered agonizing decisions in the vietnam war and felt it caused divisions both in the us and abroad johnson was afraid that if he tried to defeat the north vietnamese regime with an invasion of north vietnam rather than simply try to protect south vietnam he might provoke the chinese to stage a fullscale military intervention similar to their intervention in during the korean war as well as provoke the soviets into launching a fullscale military invasion of western europe
in a interview for the johnson presidential library oral history archives johnsons secretary of defense robert mcnamara stated that a carrier battle group the us th fleet sent on a training exercise toward gibraltar was repositioned back towards the eastern mediterranean to be able to assist israel during the sixday war of june given the rapid israeli advances following their strike on egypt the administration thought the situation was so tense in israel that perhaps the syrians fearing israel would attack them or the soviets supporting the syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack israel the soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move in a hotline message from moscow soviet premier alexei kosygin said if you want war youre going to get war
the soviet union supported its arab allies in may the soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the east mediterranean early in the crisis they began to shadow the us and british carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels the soviet naval squadron in the mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the us navy in a interview with the boston globe mcnamara claimed that we damn near had war he said kosygin was angry that we had turned around a carrier in the mediterranean
johnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency he flew miles aboard air force one while in office his october visit to australia sparked demonstrations from antiwar protesters one of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before christmas in the president began the trip by going to the memorial service for australian prime minister harold holt who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned the white house did not reveal in advance to the press that the president would make the first roundtheworld presidential trip the trip was miles completed in only hours days air force one crossed the equator twice stopped in travis air force base calif then honolulu pago pago canberra melbourne vietnam karachi and rome
as he had served less than months of president kennedys term johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the presidential election under the provisions of the nd amendment initially no prominent democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the democratic party only senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota challenged johnson as an antiwar candidate in the new hampshire primary hoping to pressure the democrats to oppose the vietnam war on march mccarthy won percent of the primary vote to johnsons percent an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger four days later sen robert f kennedy of new york entered the race internal polling by johnsons campaign in wisconsin the next state to hold a primary election showed the president trailing badly johnson did not leave the white house to campaign
by this time johnson had lost control of the democratic party which was splitting into four factions each of which generally disliked the other three the first consisted of johnson and humphrey labor unions and local party bosses led by chicago mayor richard j daley the second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind mccarthy the third group were catholics hispanics and african americans who rallied behind robert kennedy the fourth group were traditionally segregationist white southerners who rallied behind george c wallace and the american independent party vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party and johnson could see no way to win the war and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win reelection
in addition although it was not made public at the time johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another fouryear term therefore at the end of a march speech he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for reelection by concluding with the line i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president the next day his approval ratings increased from to 
historians have debated the factors that led to johnsons surprise decision shesol says johnson wanted out of the white house but also wanted vindication when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave gould says that johnson had neglected the party was hurting it by his vietnam policies and underestimated mccarthys strength until the very last minute when it was too late for johnson to recover woods said johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal dallek says that johnson had no further domestic goals and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity his health was not good and he was preoccupied with the kennedy campaign his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker bennett however says johnson had been forced out of a reelection race in by outrage over his policy in southeast asia
after robert kennedys assassination johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give humphrey the nomination at the democratic national convention personal correspondences between the president and some in the republican party suggested johnson tacitly supported nelson rockefellers campaign he reportedly said that if rockefeller became the republican nominee he would not campaign against him and would not campaign for humphrey in what was termed the october surprise johnson announced to the nation on october that he had ordered a complete cessation of all air naval and artillery bombardment of north vietnam effective november should the hanoi government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the paris peace talks in the end democrats did not fully unite behind humphrey enabling republican candidate richard nixon to win the election
johnson appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states
johnson in anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures and thought it advantageous to have a mole in the supreme court who he thought could provide him with inside information as he was able to get from the legislative branch abe fortas in particular was the individual that johnson thought could fill the bill the opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the un with adlai stevensons death associate justice arthur goldenberg accepted johnsons offer to transfer to the position only johnsons insistence as well as a slight of hand in fortas assuming goldbergs seat could overcome fortas wifes objection that it was too early in his career mrs fortas expressed unparalleled disapproval to johnson personally afterwards when earl warren announced his retirement in johnson nominated fortas to succeed him as chief justice of the united states and nominated homer thornberry to succeed fortas as associate justice however fortass nomination was filibustered by senators and neither nominee was voted upon by the full senate
in addition to his supreme court appointments johnson appointed judges to the united states courts of appeals and judges to the united states district courts johnson also had a small number of judicial appointment controversies with one appellate and three district court nominees not being confirmed by the united states senate before johnsons presidency ended
johnson continued the fbis wiretapping of martin luther king jr that had been previously authorized by the kennedy administration under attorney general robert kennedy as a result of listening to the fbis tapes remarks on kings extramarital activities were made by several prominent officials including johnson who once said that king was a hypocritical preacher johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others including the vietnamese friends of a nixon associate
during his presidency johnson issued pardons and commutations granting over percent of such requests
according to biographer radall woods johnson posed in many different roles depending on the circumstances he could be
other historians have noted how he played additional roles as kent germany reports
johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious tireless and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed he worked to hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities there was no more powerful majority leader in american history biographer robert dallek writes dallek stated that johnson had biographies on all the senators knew what their ambitions hopes and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes another johnson biographer noted he could get up every day and learn what their fears their desires their wishes their wants were and he could then manipulate dominate persuade and cajole them at feet inches m tall johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion known as the johnson treatment a contemporary writes it was an incredible blend of badgering cajolery reminders of past favors promises of future favors predictions of gloom if something doesnt happen when that man started to work on you all of a sudden you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you
johnsons cowboy hat and boots reflected his texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country from acres ha of land that he was given by an aunt in he created a acre ha working ranch with head of registered hereford cattle the national park service keeps a herd of hereford cattle descended from johnsons registered herd and maintains the ranch property
biographer randall woods argues that social gospel themes johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems this helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice as exemplified by the great society and his commitment to racial equality the social gospel explicitly inspired his foreignpolicy approach to a sort of christian internationalism and nation building for example in a speech he quoted at length from the social creed of the methodist church issued in adding it would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the american ideal
after leaving the presidency in january johnson went home to his ranch in stonewall texas accompanied by former aide and speech writer harry j middleton who would draft johnsons first book the choices we face and work with him on his memoirs entitled the vantage point perspectives of the presidency published in that year the lyndon baines johnson library and museum opened on the campus of the university of texas at austin he donated his texas ranch in his will to the public to form the lyndon b johnson national historical park with the provision that the ranch remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past
johnson gave nixon high grades in foreign policy but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing us forces too quickly before the south vietnamese were really able to defend themselves if the south falls to the communists we can have a serious backlash here at home he warned
during the presidential election johnson endorsed democratic presidential nominee george s mcgovern a senator from south dakota although mcgovern had long opposed johnsons foreign and defense policies the mcgovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him nixon could be defeated if only the democrats dont go too far left he had insisted johnson had felt edmund muskie would be more likely to defeat nixon however he declined an invitation to try to stop mcgovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help mcgovern johnsons protg john connally had served as president nixons secretary of the treasury and then stepped down to head democrats for nixon a group funded by republicans it was the first time that connally and johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign
in march johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to brooke army general hospital on fort sam houston in san antonio he was urged to lose a considerable amount of weight johnson had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the white house gaining more than pounds kg and weighing around pounds kg he had also resumed smoking after nearly fifteen years without having done so which contributed further to his health problems the following summer again gripped by chest pains he embarked on a crash water diet shedding about pounds kg in less than a month in april johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter lynda in charlottesville virginia im hurting real bad he confided to friends the chest pains hit him nearly every afternoona series of sharp jolting pains that left him scared and breathless a portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air he continued to smoke heavily and although placed on a lowcalorie lowcholesterol diet kept to it only in fits and starts meanwhile he began experiencing severe stomach pains doctors diagnosed this problem as diverticulosis pouches forming on the intestine his condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended so johnson flew to houston to consult with heart specialist dr michael debakey debakey discovered that even though two of the former presidents coronary arteries were critically damaged the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications
on inauguration day january johnson saw nixon sworn in then got on the plane to fly back to texas when the front door of the plane closed johnson pulled out a cigarettehis first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in one of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said daddy what are you doing youre going to kill yourself he took it back and said ive now raised you girls ive now been president now its my time from that point on he went into a very selfdestructive spiral
with his condition now diagnosed as terminal johnson returned home to his ranch at approximately pm central time on january johnson placed a call to the ranchs secret service compound complaining of massive chest pains the agents rushed to the former presidents bedroom finding him unresponsive with the phone receiver still in his hand johnson was airlifted in one of his own airplanes to san antonio and taken to brooke army general where he was pronounced dead on arrival at the facility by cardiologist and army colonel dr george mcgranahan
johnson who died two days after richard nixons second inauguration was the second former president to die within the span of two months at the time of his death former president harry s truman whose death made johnson the only living former president died less than a month before johnson did on december johnsons death left the united states with no living former presidents he and truman had been the only two since dwight eisenhowers death in 
shortly after johnsons death his press secretary tom johnson no relation telephoned walter cronkite at cbs cronkite was live on the air with the cbs evening news at the time and a report on vietnam was cut abruptly while cronkite was still on the line so he could break the news
johnson was honored with a state funeral in which texas congressman j j pickle and former secretary of state dean rusk eulogized him at the capitol the final services took place on january the funeral was held at the national city christian church in washington dc where he had often worshiped as president the service was presided over by president richard nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries led by former japanese prime minister eisaku sat who served as japanese prime minister during johnsons presidency eulogies were given by the rev dr george davis the churchs pastor and w marvin watson former postmaster general nixon did not speak though he attended as is customary for presidents during state funerals but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes as rusk did the day before as nixon mentioned johnsons death in a speech he gave the day after johnson died announcing the peace agreement to end the vietnam war
johnson was buried in his family cemetery which although it is part of the lyndon b johnson national historical park in stonewall texas is still privately owned by the johnson family who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery a few yards from the house in which he was born eulogies were given by john connally and the rev billy graham the minister who officiated the burial rites the state funeral the last for a president until ronald reagans in was part of an unexpectedly busy week in washington as the military district of washington mdw dealt with their second major task in less than a week beginning with nixons second inauguration the inauguration had an impact on the state funeral in various ways because johnson died only two days after the inauguration the mdw and the armed forces inaugural committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration to allow for a full state funeral and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral it also meant johnsons casket traveled the entire length of the capitol entering through the senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exited through the house wing steps due to construction on the east front steps
