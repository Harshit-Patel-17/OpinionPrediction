bush declared a state of emergency in louisiana on august and in mississippi and alabama the following day he authorized the department of homeland security dhs and federal emergency management agency fema to manage the disaster but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action the eye of the hurricane made landfall on august and new orleans began to flood due to levee breaches later that day bush declared that a major disaster existed in louisiana officially authorizing fema to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort

as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administrations role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal governments failures in its handling of the emergency it has been argued that with katrina bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover
during bushs second term a controversy arose over the justice departments midterm dismissal of seven united states attorneys the white house maintained that the us attorneys were fired for poor performance attorney general alberto gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the justice department the house judiciary committee issued subpoenas for advisers harriet miers and josh bolten to testify regarding this matter but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice the justice department determined that the presidents order was legal
although congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the us attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released on march the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas on july a united states district court judge ruled that bushs top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas
in all twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress they included attorney general alberto gonzales and his chief of staff kyle sampson gonzales liaison to the white house monica goodling aide to the president karl rove and his senior aide sara taylor in addition legal counsel to the president harriet miers and deputy chief of staff to the president joshua bolten were both found in contempt of congress
in the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal according to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense
in july bush visited pope john paul ii at castel gandolfo
during his presidential campaign bushs foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with latin america especially mexico and a reduction of involvement in nationbuilding and other smallscale military engagements the administration pursued a national missile defense bush was an advocate of chinas entry into the world trade organization
in his state of the union address bush referred to an axis of evil including iraq iran and north korea after the september attacks on new york bush launched the war on terror in which the united states military and a small international coalition invaded afghanistan in bush then launched the invasion of iraq searching for weapons of mass destruction which he described as being part of the war on terrorism those invasions led to the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan and the removal of saddam hussein from power in iraq
bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with european nations he appointed longtime adviser karen hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign bush lauded the prodemocracy struggles in georgia and ukrainecitation needed
in march a visit to india led to renewed ties between the two countries reversing decades of us policy the visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counterterrorism cooperation discussions that would lead eventually to the indiaunited states civil nuclear agreement
this is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor clinton whose approach and response to india after the nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bushs tenure
midway through bushs second term it was questioned whether bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda highlighted in policy changes toward some oilrich former soviet republics in central asia
in an address before both houses of congress on september bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the september attacks he specifically thanked uk prime minister tony blair for traveling to washington to show unity of purpose with america and said america has no truer friend than great britain
the september terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bushs presidency that evening he addressed the nation from the oval office promising a strong response to the attacks he also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims on september he visited ground zero meeting with mayor rudy giuliani firefighters police officers and volunteers bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble to much applause i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon
in a september speech bush condemned osama bin laden and his organization alqaeda and issued an ultimatum to the taliban regime in afghanistan where bin laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or share in their fate
after september bush announced a global war on terror the afghan taliban regime was not forthcoming with osama bin laden so bush ordered the invasion of afghanistan to overthrow the taliban regime in his january state of the union address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of north korea iran and iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and posed a grave and growing danger the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war this became the basis for the bush doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september attacks
dissent and criticism of bushs leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in iraq continued in a national intelligence estimate concluded that the iraq war had become the cause clbre for jihadists
on october us and british forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of northern alliance troops in kabul on november the main goals of the war were to defeat the taliban drive alqaeda out of afghanistan and capture key alqaeda leaders in december the pentagon reported that the taliban had been defeated but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening taliban and alqaeda leaders later that month the un had installed the afghan transitional administration chaired by hamid karzai in based on unicef figures nicholas kristof reported that our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid
efforts to kill or capture alqaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december in the mountainous region of tora bora which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough us ground troops it was not until may two years after bush left office that bin laden was killed by us forces bin ladens successor ayman alzawahiri remains at large
despite the initial success in driving the taliban from power in kabul by early the taliban was regrouping amassing new funds and recruits the failure of operation red wings showed that the taliban had returned in the taliban insurgency appeared larger fiercer and better organized than expected with largescale allied offensives such as operation mountain thrust attaining limited success as a result bush commissioned additional troops to the country in march 
beginning with his january state of the union address bush began publicly focusing attention on iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to us interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction
in the latter half of cia reports contained assertions of saddam husseins intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president
in late and early bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis in november hans blix and mohamed elbaradei led un weapons inspectors in iraq but were advised by the us to depart the country four days prior to the us invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks the us initially sought a un security council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for un approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries
