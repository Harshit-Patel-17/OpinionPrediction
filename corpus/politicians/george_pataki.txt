pataki was a first term state senator from westchester county when he launched his bid for the republican nomination for governor in he said he launched the campaign because of his frustration in the senate regarding how albany worked and on tax issues he was little known statewide and his campaign received a boost when he was endorsed by us sen al damato he received the partys endorsement at the spring state convention and easily defeated former state republican chairman richard rosenbaum in the september primary pataki was considered an underdog from the start since he was running against three term gov mario cuomo and because pataki had little name recognition statewide damato reportedly backed pataki because of a poll that showed a prochoice fiscal conservative from the new york city suburbs could win statewide for governor the poll also showed a female running mate for lieutenant governor would help the ticket thus leading to the selection of academic betsy mccaughey as patakis running mate
the polls had governor cuomo up by as much as ten points going into the final two weeks but they then narrowed at the end he made an issue of cuomo seeking a fourth term as governor and pledged to serve only two terms in office cuomo was helped late in the race by the endorsement of new york city mayor rudy giuliani in the end pataki narrowly defeated cuomo in the general election many including george pataki himself believe howard sterns endorsement of pataki was a major reason for his win as a result stern was present at the podium with pataki during his inauguration

pataki sought the nomination of the independence party of new york in his bid for a third term as well he faced thomas golisano the partys founder in his bid for the nomination pataki ran an active primary campaign and lost to golisano donohue did win the primary for lieutenant governor and was both the running mate of pataki and golisano in the general election
