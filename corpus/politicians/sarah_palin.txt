in palin ran for governor with a buildthebridge plank in her platform saying she would not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project into something thats so negative palin criticized the use of the word nowhere as insulting to local residents and urged speedy work on building the infrastructure while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
as governor palin canceled the gravina island bridge in september saying that congress had little interest in spending any more money due to inaccurate portrayals of the projects alaska did not return the million in federal transportation funds

palin dismissed public safety commissioner walt monegan on july citing performancerelated issues such as not being a team player on budgeting issues and egregious rogue behavior palin attorney thomas van flein said that the last straw was monegans planned trip to washington dc to seek funding for a new multimilliondollar sexual assault initiative the governor hadnt yet approved monegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from palin her husband and her staff including state attorney general talis j colberg to fire palins exbrotherinlaw alaska state trooper mike wooten wooten was involved in a child custody battle with palins sister after a bitter divorce that included an alleged death threat against palins father at one point sarah and todd palin hired a private investigator to gather information seeking to have wooten officially disciplined monegan stated that he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated and wooten had been disciplined for the others an illegal moose killing and the tasering of his yearold stepson who had reportedly asked to be tasered he told the palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed when contacted by the press for comment monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue he later asserted that the dispute over wooten was a major reason for his firing palin stated on july that monegan was not pressured to fire wooten nor dismissed for not doing so
monegan said the subject of wooten came up when he invited palin to a birthday party for his cousin state senator lyman hoffman in february during the legislative session in juneau as we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brotherinlaw monegan said i said maam i need to keep you at arms length with this i cant deal about him with you she said ok thats a good idea
palin said there was absolutely no pressure ever put on commissioner monegan to hire or fire anybody at any time i did not abuse my office powers and i dont know how to be more blunt and candid and honest but to tell you that truth to tell you that no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody todd palin gave a similar account
on august she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her administration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it she said palin said many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
chuck kopp whom palin had appointed to replace monegan as public safety commissioner received a state severance package after he resigned following just two weeks on the job kopp the former kenai chief of police resigned july following disclosure of a sexual harassment complaint and letter of reprimand against him monegan said that he did not receive a severance package from the state
on august the alaska legislature hired an investigator stephen branchflower to review the monegan dismissal legislators stated that palin had the legal authority to fire monegan but they wanted to know whether her action had been motivated by anger at monegan for not firing wooten the atmosphere was bipartisan and palin pledged to cooperate wooten remained employed as a state trooper she placed an aide on paid leave due to a taperecorded phone conversation that she deemed improper in which the aide appearing to act on her behalf complained to a trooper that wooten had not been fired
several weeks after the start of what the media referred to as troopergate palin was chosen as john mccains running mate on september palin asked the legislature to drop its investigation saying that the state personnel board had jurisdiction over ethics issues the personnel boards three members were first appointed by palins predecessor and palin reappointed one member in on september todd palin and several state employees refused to honor subpoenas the validity of which were disputed by talis colberg palins appointee as alaskas attorney general on october a court rejected colbergs challenge to the subpoenas and seven of the witnesses not including todd palin eventually testified
on october the alaska legislative council unanimously voted to release without endorsing the branchflower report in which investigator stephen branchflower found that firing monegan was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority but that palin abused her power as governor and violated the states executive branch ethics act when her office pressured monegan to fire wooten the report stated that governor palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates to advance a personal agenda to wit to get trooper michael wooten fired the report also said that palin permitted todd palin to use the governors office to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get trooper wooten fired
on october palins attorneys responded condemning the branchflower report as misleading and wrong on the law one of palins attorneys thomas van flein said that it was an attempt to smear the governor by innuendo later that day palin did a conference call interview with various alaskan reporters where she stated well im very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing any hint of any kind of unethical activity there very pleased to be cleared of any of that
the bipartisan state of alaska personnel board reviewed the matter at palins request on september the anchorage law firm of clapp peterson van flein tiemessen thorsness filed arguments of no probable cause with the personnel board on behalf of palin the personnel board retained independent counsel timothy petumenos a democrat as an investigator on october palin gave three hours of depositions with the personnel board in st louis missouri on november the state of alaska personnel board reported that there was no probable cause to believe that palin or any other state official had violated state ethical standards the report further stated that the branchflower report used the wrong statute in reaching its conclusions misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence required to properly reach findings in the matter
as governor of alaska palins job approval rating ranged from a high of in may to in may 
on july palin announced that she would not run for reelection in the alaska gubernatorial election and would resign before the end of the month in her announcement palin stated that since august both she and the state had been spending an insane amount of time and money million responding to opposition research foia requests and frivolous legal ethics complaints filed by political operatives against her her decision not to seek reelection and to resign from office would enable her to avoid being a lame duck politician who is ineffective and milk the taxpayers by drawing a paycheck and funding useless travels she said im not putting alaska through that contrary to most reports it has been reported that her decision had been in the works for months accelerating as it became clear that controversies and endless ethics investigations were threatening to overshadow her legislative agenda a source close to palin said attacks inside alaska and largely invisible to the national media had paralyzed her administration and she was no longer able to do the job she had been elected to do essentially the taxpayers were paying for sarah to go to work every day and defend herself palin and her husband todd had personally incurred more than in legal fees defending against ethics charges brought against her as governor even though all the complaints were dismissed lt governor sean parnell said it really had to do with the weight on her the concern she had for the cost of all the ethics investigations and the like the way that weighed on her with respect to her inability to just move forward alaskas agenda on behalf of alaskans in the current context of the environment the alaska governor transfer of power to sean parnell occurred in fairbanks on july
