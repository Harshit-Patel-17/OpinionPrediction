on january the new york times endorsed kasich for the republican nomination the times editorial board strongly rebuked leading candidates donald trump and senator ted cruz and wrote that kasich though a distinct underdog is the only plausible choice for republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race
on the campaign trail kasich sought to project a sunny optimistic message describing himself as the prince of light and hope this marked a change in tone for kasich who had developed a reputation as an abrasive governor viewed as a longshot contender kasich took an abovethefray approach to his rivals and ran unapologetically as a candidate with experience even as others ran as outsider contenders
kasich came in second place in the new hampshire primary on february behind winner trump the cincinnati enquirer reported that this was the best possible result for kasich and lent credence to the notion that he can emerge as a republican alternative to trump and cruz
ultimately however kasichs message never caught on in a campaign that exposed the anger and frustration coursing through the electorate and he found himself stuck in fourth place in a threeman race trailing senator marco rubio of florida in the delegate count although rubio had dropped out of the race in march
the only state won by kasich was his home state of ohio which gave him delegates in its march winnertakeall primary but still left him with a steep delegate deficit against his rivals kasichs unsuccessful campaign strategy hinged on the possibility of a contested or brokered republican national convention in which no single candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot something that has not happened in either of the two major parties presidential nominating conventions since kasich suspended his campaign for the republican presidential nomination ie effectively dropped out of the race on may one day after trump won the republican primary in indiana the third remaining contender cruz quit the race shortly before kasich did leaving trump as the only candidate remaining in the republican field and hence the partys presumptive nominee
following his withdrawal from the race kasich did not extend his support to trump in may and june kasich said that trump was a divisive figure rather than a unifier said that he had no plans to endorse trump in the near future and ruled out accepting as position as vicepresidential running mate under trump kasich stated that it was hard to say whether he would ever endorse trump and added i cant go for dividing name calling or somebody that doesnt really represent conservative principles
kasich has been married twice his first marriage was to mary lee griffith from to and they had no children griffith has campaigned for kasich since their divorce kasich and his current wife karen waldbillig a former public relations executive were married in march and have twin daughters emma and reese john has a younger brother rick age 
kasich was raised a catholic but considers denominations irrelevant and stated that theres always going to be a part of me that considers myself a catholic he drifted away from his religion as an adult but came to embrace an anglican faith after both his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver on august kasich has said he doesnt find god in church but does belong to the st augustine church in westerville ohio which is part of the anglican church in north america a conservative church that broke off from the episcopal church
