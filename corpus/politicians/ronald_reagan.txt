his final work as a professional actor was as host and performer from to on the television series death valley days

reagan began as a hollywood democrat franklin d roosevelt was his great hero he moved to the right in the s became a republican in and emerged as a leading conservative spokesman in the goldwater campaign of 
he joined numerous political committees with a leftwing orientation such as the american veterans committee he fought against republicansponsored righttowork legislation and for helen gahagan douglas in when she was defeated for the senate by richard nixon it was his realization that communists were a powerful backstage influence in those groups that led him to rally his friends against them
reagan spoke frequently at rallies with a strong ideological dimension in december he was stopped from leading an antinuclear rally in hollywood by pressure from the warner bros studio he would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency specifically his opposition to mutually assured destruction building on previous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons to a new focus to reduce the numbers and types of them in the election reagan strongly supported harry s truman appearing on stage with him during a campaign speech in los angeles however in the early s as his relationship with actress nancy davis grew he shifted to the right and endorsed the presidential candidacies of dwight d eisenhower in and as well as richard nixon in 
he was hired by general electric in to host the general electric theater a weekly tv drama series much more important he crisscrossed the country giving talks to over ge employees as a motivational speaker his many speecheswhich he wrote himselfwere nonpartisan but carried a conservative probusiness message he was influenced by lemuel boulware a senior ge executive boulware known for his tough stance against unions and his innovative strategies to win over workers championed the core tenets of modern american conservatism free markets anticommunism lower taxes and limited government eager for a larger stage but not allowed to enter politics by ge he quit and formally registered as a republican he often said i didnt leave the democratic party the party left me
when legislation that would become medicare was introduced in reagan created a recording for the american medical association warning that such legislation would mean the end of freedom in america reagan said that if his listeners did not write letters to prevent it we will awake to find that we have socialism and if you dont do this and if i dont do it one of these days you and i are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it once was like in america when men were free he also joined the national rifle association and would become a lifetime member
reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender barry goldwater in speaking for goldwater reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government consolidating themes he had developed in talks for ge he argued in a time for choosing october 
the founding fathers knew a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they knew when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose so we have come to a time for choosing you and i are told we must choose between a left or right but i suggest there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to mans ageold dream the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism
this a time for choosing speech was not enough to turn around the faltering goldwater campaign but it was the key event that established reagans national political visibility
california republicans were impressed with reagans political views and charisma after his time for choosing speech he announced in late his campaign for governor of california in he defeated former san francisco mayor george christopher in the gop primary in reagans campaign he emphasized two main themes to send the welfare bums back to work and in reference to burgeoning antiwar and antiestablishment student protests at the university of california at berkeley to clean up the mess at berkeley ronald reagan accomplished in what us senator william f knowland in and former vice president richard nixon in had tried he was elected defeating twoterm governor edmund g pat brown and was sworn in on january in his first term he froze government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget
shortly after the beginning of his term reagan tested the presidential waters in as part of a stop nixon movement hoping to cut into nixons southern support and be a compromise candidate if neither nixon nor secondplace nelson rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the republican convention however by the time of the convention nixon had delegate votes more than he needed to secure the nomination followed by rockefeller with reagan in third place
reagan was involved in highprofile conflicts with the protest movements of the era on may during the peoples park protests at uc berkeley reagan sent the california highway patrol and other officers to quell the protests in an incident that became known as bloody thursday resulting in the death of student james rector and the blinding of carpenter alan blanchard reagan then called out state national guard troops to occupy the city of berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters a year after bloody thursday reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying if it takes a bloodbath lets get it over with no more appeasement when the symbionese liberation army kidnapped patty hearst in berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food conversely in that one afternoon bloody thursday police officers were injured including one chp officer who was knifed in the chest after calling in the national guard the guard remained in berkeley for days camping in peoples park and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordonedoff fencing and placed all development plans for peoples park on hold
early in the national debate on abortion was beginning democratic california state senator anthony c beilenson introduced the therapeutic abortion act in an effort to reduce the number of backroom abortions performed in california the state legislature sent the bill to reagans desk where after many days of indecision he signed it about two million abortions would be performed as a result most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the wellbeing of the mother reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor he would not have signed it after he recognized what he called the consequences of the bill he announced that he was prolife he maintained that position later in his political career writing extensively about abortion
in reagan signed the mulford act which became california penal code and c the bill repealed a law allowing public carrying of loaded firearms named after republican assemblyman don mulford the bill garnered national attention after the black panthers marched bearing arms upon the california state capitol to protest the bill
despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in reagan was reelected in defeating big daddy jesse m unruh he chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle one of reagans greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment which he strongly supported his efforts to enforce the states laws in this area were thwarted when the supreme court of california issued its people v anderson decision which invalidated all death sentences issued in california before though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment the only execution during reagans governorship was on april when aaron mitchells sentence was carried out by the state in san quentins gas chamber
in reagan as governor signed the family law act an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the california state legislature for over two years and became the first nofault divorce legislation in the united states
reagans terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president by campaigning on a platform of sending the welfare bums back to work he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state he also strongly advocated the republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy including that of undue federal taxation
reagan did not seek reelection to a third term as governor in and was succeeded by democratic california secretary of state jerry brown on january 
in reagan challenged incumbent president gerald ford in a bid to become the republican partys candidate for president reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of likeminded organizations such as the american conservative union which became key components of his political base while president ford was considered a more moderate republican
reagans campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager john sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of fords likely nomination reagan won north carolina texas and california but the strategy failed as he ended up losing new hampshire florida and his native illinois the texas campaign lent renewed hope to reagan when he swept all ninetysix delegates chosen in the may primary with four more awaiting at the state convention much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three cochairmen including ernest angelo the mayor of midland and ray barnhart of houston whom president reagan would appoint in as director of the federal highway administration
however as the gop convention neared ford appeared close to victory acknowledging his partys moderate wing reagan chose moderate senator richard schweiker of pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated nonetheless ford prevailed with delegates to reagans ford would go on to lose the presidential election to the democrat jimmy carter
reagans concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the soviet union though he lost the nomination he received writein votes in new hampshire votes as an independent on wyomings ballot and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the november election from the state of washington which ford had won over democratic challenger jimmy carter
after the campaign reagan remained in the public debate with the ronald reagan radio commentary series and his political action committee citizens for the republic which was later revived in alexandria virginia in by the reagan biographer craig shirley
the presidential campaign between reagan and incumbent president jimmy carter was conducted during domestic concerns and the ongoing iran hostage crisis his campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles lower taxes to stimulate the economy less government interference in peoples lives states rights and a strong national defense
reagan launched his campaign by declaring i believe in states rights after receiving the republican nomination reagan selected one of his primary opponents george h w bush to be his running mate his showing in the october televised debate boosted his campaign reagan won the election carrying states with electoral votes to electoral votes for carter representing six states and washington dc reagan received of the popular vote while carter took and independent john b anderson a liberal republican received republicans captured the senate for the first time since and gained house seats but the democrats retained a majority
during his presidency reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom brought changes domestically both to the us economy and expanded military and contributed to the end of the cold war termed the reagan revolution his presidency would reinvigorate american morale reinvigorate the american economy and reduce american reliance upon government as president reagan kept a diary in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day the diaries were published in may in the bestselling book the reagan diaries

in reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer the school prayer had previously been banned by the supreme court in and reagans election reflected an opposition to the courts decision reagans proposed amendment stated nothing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions no person shall be required by the united states or by any state to participate in prayer in a message to congress reagan said that his proposed amendment would restore the simple freedom of our citizens to offer prayer in public schools and institutions in a nationally televised speech the following day rabbi menachem mendel schneerson lauded reagans speech and said the moment of silence would ensure that children grow up to be decent and upright in reagan again raised the issue asking congress why cant the freedom to acknowledge god be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land in reagan expressed his disappointment that the supreme court ruling still bans a moment of silence for publicschool and said he had an uphill battle in reagan again renewed his call for congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end the expulsion of god from americas classrooms during his term in office reagan campaigned vigorously to restore prayer to the schools first as a moment of prayer and later as a moment of silence
on march only days into the new administration reagan his press secretary james brady washington police officer thomas delahanty and secret service agent tim mccarthy were struck by gunfire from wouldbe assassin john hinckley jr outside the washington hilton hotel although close to death upon arrival at george washington university hospital reagan was stabilized in the emergency room then underwent emergency exploratory surgery he recovered and was released from the hospital on april becoming the first serving us president to survive being shot in an assassination attempt the attempt had great influence on reagans popularity polls indicated his approval rating to be around reagan believed that god had spared his life so that he might go on to fulfill a greater purpose
in response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners reagan in nominated ernest w lefever as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the senate committee rejected his nomination by vote of lefever withdrew his name
in summer patco the union of federal air traffic controllers went on strike violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking declaring the situation an emergency as described in the tafthartley act reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers do not report for work within hours they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated they did not return and on august reagan fired striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nations commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained a leading reference work on public administration concluded the firing of patco employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared
during jimmy carters last year in office inflation averaged compared with during reagans last year in office during reagans administration the unemployment rate declined from to with the rate reaching highs of in and in averaging over the eight years and real gdp growth averaged with a high of in while nominal gdp growth averaged and peaked at in 
reagan implemented policies based on supplyside economics advocating a laissezfaire philosophy and freemarket fiscal policy seeking to stimulate the economy with large acrosstheboard tax cuts he also supported returning the united states to some sort of gold standard and successfully urged congress to establish the us gold commission to study how one could be implemented citing the economic theories of arthur laffer reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation a theory that entered political discussion as the laffer curve reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt his policy of peace through strength resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a real increase in defense spending between and 
during reagans presidency federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from to and the lowest bracket from to however other tax increases passed by congress and signed by reagan ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were of gdp as compared to over the year period then in the job training partnership act of was signed into law initiating one of the united states first publicprivate partnerships and a major part of the presidents job creation program reagans assistant secretary of labor and chief of staff al angrisani was a primary architect of the bill
conversely congress passed and reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from to to continue funding such government programs as tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra social security and the deficit reduction act of defra despite the fact that tefra was the largest peacetime tax increase in american history gross domestic product gdp growth recovered strongly after the early s recession ended in and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of per year with a high of growth in unemployment peaked at monthly rate in december higher than any time since the great depressionthen dropped during the rest of reagans presidency sixteen million new jobs were created while inflation significantly decreased the tax reform act of another bipartisan effort championed by reagan simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks the top rate was dropped to but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from to the increase of the lowest tax bracket from to was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption standard deduction and earned income tax credit the net result was the removal of six million poor americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels
the net effect of all reaganera tax bills was a decrease in government revenues when compared to treasury department revenue estimates from the administrations first postenactment january budgets however federal income tax receipts increased from to rising from billion to billion or an average annual rate of attributed to higher social security receipts and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 
reagans policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment which would then lead to higher employment and wages critics labeled this trickledown economicsthe belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a trickledown effect to the poor questions arose whether reagans policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty and many poor and minority citizens viewed reagan as indifferent to their struggles these views were exacerbated by the fact that reagans economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at an hour slashing federal assistance to local governments by cutting the budget for public housing and section rent subsidies in half and eliminating the antipoverty community development block grant program the widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the s before reagans economic policies took effect along with reagans cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages with both topping out at reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency all in the name of fiscal responsibility according to paul krugman over all the tax increase undid about a third of the cut as a share of gdp the increase was substantially larger than mrclintons tax increase according to historian and domestic policy adviser bruce bartlett reagans tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the tax cut
further following his opposition to government intervention reagan cut the budgets of nonmilitary programs including medicaid food stamps federal education programs and the epa while he protected entitlement programs such as social security and medicare his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the social security disability rolls
the administrations stance toward the savings and loan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis it is also suggested by a minority of reaganomics critics that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash in order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits the united states borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad raising the national debt from billion to trillion reagan described the new debt as the greatest disappointment of his presidency
he reappointed paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve and in he appointed monetarist alan greenspan to succeed him reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early s the price of oil subsequently dropped and the s did not see the fuel shortages that the s had reagan also fulfilled a campaign promise to repeal the windfall profit tax in which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil some economists such as nobel prize winners milton friedman and robert mundell argue that reagans tax policies invigorated americas economy and contributed to the economic boom of the s other economists such as nobel prize winner robert solow argue that reagans deficits were a major reason his successor george hw bush reneged on a campaign promise and resorted to raising taxes
during reagans presidency a program was initiated within the us intelligence community to ensure americas economic strength the program project socrates developed and demonstrated the means required for the united states to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantageautomated innovation to ensure that the united states acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation reagan during his second term had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the project socrates results on a nationwide basis however reagans term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed and the incoming bush administration labeling project socrates as industrial policy had it terminated
reagan escalated the cold war accelerating a reversal from the policy of dtente which began in after the soviet war in afghanistan reagan ordered a massive buildup of the united states armed forces and implemented new policies towards the soviet union reviving the b lancer program that had been canceled by the carter administration and producing the mx missile in response to soviet deployment of the ss reagan oversaw natos deployment of the pershing missile in west germany
in journalist nicholas lemann interviewed reagan secretary of defense caspar weinberger and summarized the strategy of the reagan administration to roll back the soviet union
their society is economically weak and it lacks the wealth education and technology to enter the information age they have thrown everything into military production and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result they cant sustain military production the way we can eventually it will break them and then there will be just one superpower in a safe world if only if we can keep spending
lemann notes that when he wrote that in he thought the reaganites were living in a fantasy world but in he says that passage represents a fairly uncontroversial description of what reagan actually did
together with the united kingdoms prime minister margaret thatcher reagan denounced the soviet union in ideological terms in a famous address on june to the british parliament in the royal gallery of the palace of westminster reagan said the forward march of freedom and democracy will leave marxismleninism on the ash heap of history on march he predicted that communism would collapse stating communism is another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written in a speech to the national association of evangelicals on march reagan called the soviet union an evil empire
after soviet fighters downed korean air lines flight near moneron island on september carrying people including georgia congressman larry mcdonald reagan labeled the act a massacre and declared that the soviets had turned against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere the reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all soviet passenger air service to the united states and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the soviets wounding them financially as result of the shootdown and the cause of kal s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system reagan announced on september that the global positioning system would be made available for civilian use free of charge once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future
under a policy that came to be known as the reagan doctrine reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anticommunist resistance movements in an effort to rollback sovietbacked communist governments in africa asia and latin america reagan deployed the cias special activities division to afghanistan and pakistan they were instrumental in training equipping and leading mujaheddin forces against the soviet army president reagans covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan though some of the united states funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to us troops in the s decade war in afghanistan however in a break from the carter policy of arming taiwan under the taiwan relations act reagan also agreed with the communist government in china to reduce the sale of arms to taiwan

the reagan administration largely ignored the aids crisis which began to unfold in the united states in the same year reagan took office aids research was chronically underfunded during reagans administration and requests for more funding by doctors at the centers for disease control cdc were routinely denied by the end of the first months of the epidemic when more than people had died of aids in the us the cdc had spent less than million on aids research in contrast funding had been made amply available to the cdc in their efforts to stop legionnaires disease after an outbreak in the cdc had spent million in fighting legionnaires disease though the outbreak had caused fewer than deaths
by the time president reagan had given his first speech on the epidemic some six years into his presidency americans had been diagnosed with aids and had died of it by the end of the year reagan left office people had been diagnosed with aids in the united states and more than of them had died of it it has been suggested that far fewer would have died both then and in the decades that followed if the reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting aids as gerald fords administration had applied to fighting legionnaires disease
relations between libya and the united states under president reagan were continually contentious beginning with the gulf of sidra incident in by libyan leader muammar gaddafi was considered by the cia to be along with ussr leader leonid brezhnev and cuban leader fidel castro part of a group known as the unholy trinity and was also labeled as our international public enemy number one by a cia official these tensions were later revived in early april when a bomb exploded in a berlin discothque resulting in the injury of american military personnel and death of one serviceman stating that there was irrefutable proof that libya had directed the terrorist bombing reagan authorized the use of force against the country in the late evening of april the united states launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in libya

reagan signed the immigration reform and control act in the act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants required employers to attest to their employees immigration status and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the united states before january and had lived in the country continuously critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished statue of liberty reagan said the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and ultimately if they choose they may become americans reagan also said the employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element it will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here

until the early s the united states had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the soviets but the gap had been narrowed although the soviet union did not accelerate military spending after president reagans military buildup their large military expenses in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing were a heavy burden for the soviet economy at the same time saudi arabia increased oil production which resulted in a drop of oil prices in to onethird of the previous level oil was the main source of soviet export revenues these factors contributed to a stagnant soviet economy during gorbachevs tenure
reagan recognized the change in the direction of the soviet leadership with mikhail gorbachev and shifted to diplomacy with a view to encourage the soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements reagans personal mission was to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons which he regarded as totally irrational totally inhumane good for nothing but killing possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization he was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with general secretary gorbachev gorbachev and reagan held four summit conferences between and the first in geneva switzerland the second in reykjavk iceland the third in washington dc and the fourth in moscow reagan believed that if he could persuade the soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech this would lead to reform and the end of communism
speaking at the berlin wall on june reagan challenged gorbachev to go further saying general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall
before gorbachevs visit to washington dc for the third summit in the soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements the timing of the announcement led western diplomats to contend that gorbachev was offering major concessions to the united states on the levels of conventional forces nuclear weapons and policy in eastern europe he and reagan signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf at the white house which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons the two leaders laid the framework for the strategic arms reduction treaty or start i reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from strategic arms limitation talks to strategic arms reduction talks
when reagan visited moscow for the fourth summit in he was viewed as a celebrity by the soviets a journalist asked the president if he still considered the soviet union the evil empire no he replied i was talking about another time another era at gorbachevs request reagan gave a speech on free markets at the moscow state university in his autobiography an american life reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for gorbachev in november ten months after reagan left office the berlin wall was opened the cold war was unofficially declared over at the malta summit on december and two years later the soviet union collapsed

reagan also nominated vaughn walker who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge to the united states district court for the central district of california however the nomination stalled in the senate and walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by reagans successor george hw bush
early in his tenure reagan appointed clarence m pendleton jr of san diego as the first african american to chair the united states commission on civil rights pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with reagans views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from until his sudden death in pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the comparable worth proposal as being looney tunes

after his diagnosis letters of support from wellwishers poured into his california home
but there was also speculation over how long reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration former cbs white house correspondent lesley stahl recounted that in her final meeting with the president in reagan did not seem to know who stahl was and that she came close to reporting that reagan was senile but at the end of the meeting reagan had regained his alertness however dr lawrence k altman a physician employed as a reporter for the new york times noted that the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of alzheimers can be fuzzy and all four of reagans white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimers while he was president dr john e hutton reagans primary physician from to said the president absolutely did not show any signs of dementia or alzheimers his former chief of staff james baker considered ludicrous the idea that reagan slept during cabinet meetings other staff members former aides and friends said they saw no indication of alzheimers while he was president reagan did experience occasional memory lapses though especially with names reagans doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late or several years after he had left office for example reagan repeated a toast to margaret thatcher with identical words and gestures at his ndbirthday party on feb 
complicating the picture reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in july five years before his diagnosis after being thrown from a horse in mexico a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year nancy reagan citing what doctors told her asserts that her husbands fall hastened the onset of alzheimers disease although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate alzheimers or dementia reagans onetime physician daniel ruge has said it is possible but not certain that the horse accident affected the course of reagans memory
as the years went on the disease slowly destroyed reagans mental capacity he was only able to recognize a few people including his wife nancy he remained active however he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches played golf regularly and until he often went to his office in nearby century city
reagan suffered a fall at his bel air home on january resulting in a broken hip the fracture was repaired the following day and the yearold reagan returned home later that week although he faced difficult physical therapy at home on february reagan reached the age of becoming the third former president to do so the other two being john adams and herbert hoover with gerald ford george h w bush and jimmy carter later reaching reagans public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease and as a result his family decided that he would live in quiet semiisolation with his wife nancy nancy reagan told cnns larry king in that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that ronnie would want people to remember him as he was after her husbands diagnosis and death nancy reagan became a stemcell research advocate urging congress and president george w bush to support federal funding for embryonic stemcell research something bush opposed in she praised president barack obama for lifting restrictions on such research mrs reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for alzheimers
reagan died of pneumonia complicated by alzheimers disease at his home in bel air california on the afternoon of june a short time after his death nancy reagan released a statement saying my family and i would like the world to know that president ronald reagan has died after years of alzheimers disease at years of age we appreciate everyones prayers president george w bush declared june a national day of mourning and international tributes came in from around the world reagans body was taken to the kingsley and gates funeral home in santa monica california later in the day where wellwishers paid tribute by laying flowers and american flags in the grass on june his body was removed and taken to the ronald reagan presidential library where a brief family funeral was held conducted by pastor michael wenning his body lay in repose in the library lobby until june over people viewed the coffin

his burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the ronald reagan presidential library i know in my heart that man is good that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life
since reagan left office in substantial debate has occurred among scholars historians and the general public surrounding his legacy supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of reagans economic policies foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the cold war and a restoration of american pride and morale proponents also argue reagan restored faith in the american dream with his unabated and passionate love for the united states after a decline in american confidence and selfrespect under jimmy carters perceived weak leadership particularly during the iranian hostage crisis as well as his gloomy dreary outlook for the future of the united states during the election critics contend that reagans economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits a wider gap in wealth and an increase in homelessness and that the irancontra affair lowered american credibility
opinions of reagans legacy among the countrys leading policy makers and journalists differ as well edwin feulner president of the heritage foundation said that reagan helped create a safer freer world and said of his economic policies he took an america suffering from malaise and made its citizens believe again in their destiny however mark weisbrot codirector of the center for economic and policy research contended that reagans economic policies were mostly a failure while howard kurtz of the washington post opined that reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest
despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d roosevelt leaving his imprint on american politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising since he left office historians have reached a consensus as summarized by british historian m j heale who finds that scholars now concur that reagan rehabilitated conservatism turned the nation to the right practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics revived faith in the presidency and in american exceptionalism and contributed to victory in the cold war
the cold war was a major political economic and military endeavor for over four decades but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of reagans presidency the significance of reagans role in ending the cold war has spurred contentious and opinionated debate that reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the soviet union is agreed but the extent of this role is continuously debated with many believing that reagans defense policies economic policies military policies and hard line rhetoric against the soviet union and communism as well as summits with general secretary gorbachev played a significant part in ending the cold war
he was first among postworld war ii presidents to put into practice the concept that the soviet union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with a postdtente strategy a conviction that was vindicated by gennadi gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman under gorbachev who said that the strategic defense initiative was very successful blackmail the soviet economy couldnt endure such competition reagans aggressive rhetoric toward the ussr had mixed effects jeffery w knopf observes that being labeled evil probably made no difference to the soviets but gave encouragement to the easteuropean citizens opposed to communism
general secretary gorbachev said of his former rivals cold war role he was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the cold war and deemed him a great president gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war but rather a peaceful end he said he was not intimidated by reagans harsh rhetoric margaret thatcher former prime minister of the united kingdom said of reagan he warned that the soviet union had an insatiable drive for military power but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform she later said ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired said brian mulroney former prime minister of canada he enters history as a strong and dramatic player in the cold war former president lech wasa of poland acknowledged reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communisms collapse that reagan had little or no effect in ending the cold war is argued with equal weight that communisms internal weakness had become apparent and the soviet union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power president harry s trumans policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the ussr and the soviet invasion of afghanistan undermined the soviet system itself
ronald reagan reshaped the republican party led the modern conservative movement and altered the political dynamic of the united states more men voted republican under reagan and reagan tapped into religious voters the socalled reagan democrats were a result of his presidency
after leaving office reagan became an iconic influence within the republican party his policies and beliefs have been frequently invoked by republican presidential candidates since the republican presidential candidates were no exception for they aimed to liken themselves to him during the primary debates even imitating his campaign strategies republican nominee john mccain frequently said that he came to office as a foot soldier in the reagan revolution reagans most famous statement regarding the role of smaller government was that government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
reagan has become an iconic figure in the republican party with praise for his accomplishments part of the standard gop rhetoric a quarter century after his retirement washington post reporter carlos lozada notes how in the presidential race the main republican contenders have adopted standard gop gipper worship including even donald trump who previously had been skeptical
the period of american history most dominated by ronald reagan and his policies concerning taxes welfare defense the federal judiciary and the cold war is known today as the reagan era and emphasizes that the conservative reagan revolution led by reagan had a permanent impact on the united states in domestic and foreign policy the clinton presidency is often treated as an extension of the reagan era as is the bush presidency historian eric foner noted that the obama candidacy in aroused a great deal of wishful thinking among those yearning for a change after nearly thirty years of reaganism
campaigning for the democratic nomination in barack obama an american liberal interpreted how reagan changed the nations trajectory
i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not he put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it i think they felt like with all the excesses of the s and s and government had grown and grown but there wasnt much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating i think that people he just tapped into what people were already feeling which was we want clarity we want optimism we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing
according to columnist chuck raasch reagan transformed the american presidency in ways that only a few have been able to he redefined the political agenda of the times advocating lower taxes a conservative economic philosophy and a stronger military his role in the cold war further enhanced his image as a different kind of leader reagans avuncular style optimism and plainfolks demeanor also helped him turn governmentbashing into an art form

reagans ability to connect with americans earned him the laudatory moniker the great communicator of it reagan said i won the nickname the great communicator but i never thought it was my style that made a differenceit was the content i wasnt a great communicator but i communicated great things his age and softspoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image
reagan also earned the nickname the teflon president in that public perceptions of him were not tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration according to congresswoman patricia schroeder who coined the phrase and reporter howard kurtz the epithet referred to reagans ability to do almost anything wrong and not get blamed for it
public reaction to reagan was always mixed the oldest president was supported by young voters and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the republican party reagan did not fare well with minority groups especially africanamericans this was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies however his support of israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many jews he emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency although he was the first president to have been divorced the combination of reagans speaking style unabashed patriotism negotiation skills as well as his savvy use of the media played an important role in defining the s and his future legacy
reagan was known to joke frequently during his lifetime displayed humor throughout his presidency and was famous for his storytelling his numerous jokes and oneliners have been labeled classic quips and legendary among the most notable of his jokes was one regarding the cold war as a microphone test in preparation for his weekly radio address in august reagan made the following joke my fellow americans im pleased to tell you today that ive signed legislation that will outlaw russia forever we begin bombing in five minutes former aide david gergen commented it was that humor that i think endeared people to reagan
