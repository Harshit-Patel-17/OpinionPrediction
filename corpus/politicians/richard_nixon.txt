nixon first gained national attention in when his investigation as a member of the house unamerican activities committee huac broke the alger hiss spy case while many doubted whittaker chambers allegations that hiss a former state department official had been a soviet spy nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation under suit for defamation filed by hiss chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations these included paper and microfilm copies that chambers turned over to house investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field they became known as the pumpkin papers hiss was convicted of perjury in for denying under oath he had passed documents to chambers in nixon successfully crossfiled as a candidate in his district winning both major party primaries and was comfortably reelected

in the senate nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat he maintained friendly relations with his fellow anticommunist the controversial wisconsin senator joseph mccarthy but was careful to keep some distance between himself and mccarthys allegations nixon also criticized president harry s trumans handling of the korean war he supported statehood for alaska and hawaii voted in favor of civil rights for minorities and supported federal disaster relief for india and yugoslavia he voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions benefits for illegal immigrants and public power
general dwight d eisenhower was nominated for president by the republicans in he had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate and republican officeholders and party officials met in a smokefilled room and recommended nixon to the general who agreed to the senators selection nixons youth he was then stance against communism and political base in californiaone of the largest stateswere all seen as votewinners by the leaders among the candidates considered along with nixon were ohio senator robert a taft new jersey governor alfred driscoll and illinois senator everett dirksen on the campaign trail eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate
in midseptember the republican ticket faced a major crisis the media reported that nixon had a political fund maintained by his backers which reimbursed him for political expenses such a fund was not illegal but it exposed nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest with pressure building for eisenhower to demand nixons resignation from the ticket the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on september the address later termed the checkers speech was heard by about million americansincluding the largest television audience up to that point nixon emotionally defended himself stating that the fund was not secret nor had donors received special favors he painted himself as a man of modest means his wife had no mink coat instead she wore a respectable republican cloth coat and a patriot the speech would be remembered for the gift which nixon had received but which he would not give back a little cocker spaniel dog sent all the way from texas and our little girltricia the yearoldnamed it checkers the speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for nixon eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket which proved victorious in the november election
eisenhower gave nixon responsibilities during his term as vice presidentmore than any previous vice president nixon attended cabinet and national security council meetings and chaired them when eisenhower was absent a tour of the far east succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the united states and prompted nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center he visited saigon and hanoi in french indochina on his return to the united states at the end of nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations
biographer irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional years said of his vice presidency
eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office the vice president welcomed the presidents initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish white house objectives because of the collaboration between these two leaders nixon deserves the title the first modern vice president
despite intense campaigning by nixon who reprised his strong attacks on the democrats the republicans lost control of both houses of congress in the elections these losses caused nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term on september president eisenhower suffered a heart attack his condition was initially believed to be lifethreatening eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks the th amendment to the united states constitution had not yet been proposed and the vice president had no formal power to act nonetheless nixon acted in eisenhowers stead during this period presiding over cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and cabinet officers did not seek power according to nixon biographer stephen ambrose nixon had earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis he made no attempt to seize power
his spirits buoyed nixon sought a second term but some of eisenhowers aides aimed to displace him in a december meeting eisenhower proposed that nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a presidential run and instead become a cabinet officer in a second eisenhower administration nixon however believed such an action would destroy his political career when eisenhower announced his reelection bid in february he hedged on the choice of his running mate stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated although no republican was opposing eisenhower nixon received a substantial number of writein votes against the president in the new hampshire primary election in late april the president announced that nixon would again be his running mate eisenhower and nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the november election
in the spring of nixon undertook another major foreign trip this time to africa on his return he helped shepherd the civil rights act of through congress the bill was weakened in the senate and civil rights leaders were divided over whether eisenhower should sign it nixon advised the president to sign the bill which he did eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in november and nixon gave a press conference assuring the nation that the cabinet was functioning well as a team during eisenhowers brief illness
on april richard and pat nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of south america in montevideo uruguay nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus where he fielded questions from students on us foreign policy the trip was uneventful until the nixon party reached lima peru where he was met with student demonstrations nixon went to the campus got out of his car to confront the students and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects at his hotel nixon faced another mob and one demonstrator spat on him in caracas venezuela nixon and his wife were spat on by antiamerican demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipewielding mob according to ambrose nixons courageous conduct caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect
in july president eisenhower sent nixon to the soviet union for the opening of the american national exhibition in moscow on july while touring the exhibits with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the two stopped at a model of an american kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the kitchen debate
in nixon launched his first campaign for president of the united states he faced little opposition in the republican primaries and chose former massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge jr as his running mate his democratic opponent was john f kennedy and the race remained close for the duration nixon campaigned on his experience but kennedy called for new blood and claimed the eisenhowernixon administration had allowed the soviet union to overtake the us in ballistic missiles the missile gap a new political medium was introduced in the campaign televised presidential debates in the first of four such debates nixon appeared pale with a five oclock shadow in contrast to the photogenic kennedy nixons performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television though many people listening on the radio thought that nixon had won nixon lost the election narrowly with kennedy ahead by only votes percent in the popular vote
there were charges of vote fraud in texas and illinois both states won by kennedy nixon refused to consider contesting the election feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the united states in the eyes of the world and the uncertainty would hurt us interests at the end of his term of office as vice president in january nixon and his family returned to california where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book six crises which included coverage of the hiss case eisenhowers heart attack and the fund crisis which had been resolved by the checkers speech
local and national republican leaders encouraged nixon to challenge incumbent pat brown for governor of california in the election despite initial reluctance nixon entered the race the campaign was clouded by public suspicion that nixon viewed the office as a steppingstone for another presidential run some opposition from the farright of the party and his own lack of interest in being californias governor nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nations leading active republican politician and ensure he remained a major player in national politics instead he lost to brown by more than five percentage points and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent saying you wont have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is my last press conference the california defeat was highlighted in the november episode of abcs howard k smith news and comment entitled the political obituary of richard m nixon alger hiss appeared on the program and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president the furor drove smith and his program from the air and public sympathy for nixon grew
the nixon family traveled to europe in where nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited the family moved to new york city where nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm nixon mudge rose guthrie alexander nixon had pledged when announcing his california campaign not to run for president in even if he had not he believed it would be difficult to defeat kennedy or after his assassination kennedys successor lyndon johnson in he supported arizona senator barry goldwater for the republican nomination for president when goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention although he thought goldwater unlikely to win nixon campaigned for him loyally the election was a disaster for the republicans goldwaters landslide loss to johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in congress and among state governors
nixon was one of the few leading republicans not blamed for the disastrous results and he sought to build on that in the congressional elections he campaigned for many republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the johnson landslide and received credit for helping the republicans make major gains in the midterm election
at the end of nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time although pat nixon did not always enjoy public life for example she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the checkers speech she was supportive of her husbands ambitions nixon believed that with the democrats torn over the issue of the vietnam war a republican had a good chance of winning although he expected the election to be as close as in 
one of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the tet offensive was launched followed by the withdrawal of president johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the new hampshire primary it concluded with the assassination of one of the democratic candidates senator robert f kennedy just moments after his victory in the california primary on the republican side nixons main opposition was michigan governor george romney though new york governor nelson rockefeller and california governor ronald reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats
nixons democratic opponent in the general election was vice president hubert humphrey who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right
nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in front of cameras he stressed that the crime rate was too high and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the democrats of the united states nuclear superiority nixon promised peace with honor in the vietnam war and proclaimed that new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the pacific he did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war resulting in media intimations that he must have a secret plan his slogan of nixons the one proved to be effective
johnsons negotiators hoped to reach a truce in vietnam prior to the election nixon received astute analysis on the talks from henry kissinger then a consultant to us negotiator averell harriman and his campaign was in regular contact with anna chennault in saigon she advised south vietnamese president thieu not to go to paris to join the talks hinting that nixon would give him a better deal if elected johnson was aware of what was going on as he had both chennault and the south vietnamese ambassador to washington bugged and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by nixon to undermine us foreign policy on october with no agreement johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing and that peace negotiations would start in paris on november the day after election day on november after speaking with chennault again thieu stated he would not go to paris johnson telephoned nixon who denied any involvement the president did not believe him johnson felt he could not publicly mention chennaults involvement which had been obtained by wiretapping but told humphrey who chose not to use the information
in a threeway race between nixon humphrey and independent candidate former alabama governor george wallace nixon defeated humphrey by nearly votes seventenths of a percentage point with electoral votes to for humphrey and for wallace in his victory speech nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together nixon said i have received a very gracious message from the vice president congratulating me for winning the election i congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds i also told him that i know exactly how he felt i know how it feels to lose a close one
nixon was inaugurated as president on january sworn in by his onetime political rival chief justice earl warren pat nixon held the family bibles open at isaiah which reads they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks in his inaugural address which received almost uniformly positive reviews nixon remarked that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemakera phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone he spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity
in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices
nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china even before he became president writing in foreign affairs a year before his election there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadirborder clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in officenixon sent private word to the chinese that he desired closer relations a breakthrough came in early when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on july it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world the secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact
in february nixon and his wife traveled to china kissinger briefed nixon for over hours in preparation upon touching down the president and first lady emerged from air force one and greeted chinese premier zhou enlai nixon made a point of shaking zhous hand something which thensecretary of state john foster dulles had refused to do in when the two met in geneva over television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised
nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou the joint communique following this meeting recognized taiwan as a part of china and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals
the visit ushered in a new era of sinoamerican relations fearing the possibility of a sinoamerican alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for dtente with the united states
when nixon took office about american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with violent protests against the war ongoing the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack
nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of north vietnamese and allied khmer rouge positions in cambodia in march codenamed operation menu a policy begun under johnson these operations resulted in heavy bombing of cambodia by one measurement more bombs were dropped over cambodia under johnson and nixon than the allies dropped during world war ii in mid nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement in may he publicly proposed to withdraw all american troops from south vietnam provided north vietnam also did so and for south vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with viet cong participation
in july nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyn vn thiu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may documents uncovered from the soviet archives after reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots thensecondincommand nuon chea nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue
in excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers
as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in 
nixon had been a firm supporter of kennedy in the bay of pigs invasion and cuban missile crisis on taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba and break the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the understanding despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process had not yet been completed when the soviets began expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the accord were exchanged in november
the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september spurred nixon and kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to allende first designed to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup other support included strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents it was even alleged that nixon personally authorized in covert funds to print antiallende messages in a prominent chilean newspaper following an extended period of social political and economic unrest general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup dtat on september among the dead was allende
nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace following the announcement of his visit to china the nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the soviet union the president and first lady arrived in moscow on may and met with leonid brezhnev the general secretary of the communist party alexei kosygin the chairman of the council of ministers and nikolai podgorny the head of state among other leading soviet officials
nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin
seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy
i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and dtente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept
having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in he arrived in moscow on june to a welcome ceremony cheering crowds and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening nixon and brezhnev met in yalta where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact dtente and mirvs while he considered proposing a comprehensive testban treaty nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it there were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations
as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle eastparticularly israel iran and saudi arabiaduring the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed thatexcept during the suez crisisthe us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first termfor one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelectiona
on october an arab coalition led by egypt and syria supported with tons of arms and materiel by the soviet union attacked israel in what was known as the yom kippur war israel suffered heavy losses and nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses cutting through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations more than a week later by the time the us and soviet union began negotiating a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory the truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis when israel gained the upperhand egyptian president sadat requested a joint usussr peacekeeping mission which the us refused when soviet premier brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily nixon ordered the us military to defcon placing all us military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war this was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the cuban missile crisis brezhnev backed down as a result of nixons actions
because israels victory was largely due to us support the arab opec nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the us resulting in the oil crisis the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace in the middle east took hold
after the war and under nixons presidency the us reestablished relations with egypt for the first time since nixon used the middle east crisis to restart the stalled middle east peace negotiations he wrote in a confidential memo to kissinger on october 
i believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in years to build a lasting peace in the middle east i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by i now consider a permanent middle east settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves
nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the middle east in june and became the first president to visit israel
at the time nixon took office in inflation was at percentits highest rate since the korean war the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits unemployment was low but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war this could not be accomplished overnight and the us economy continued to struggle through contributing to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency according to political economist nigel bowles in his study of nixons economic record the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency
nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection as part of his new federalism views he proposed grants to the states but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process however nixon gained political credit for advocating them in congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes though the democratic majorities knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out
by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself
nixons policies dampened inflation through although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration
after he won reelection nixon found inflation returning he reimposed price controls in june the price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy the controls produced food shortages as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss despite the failure to control inflation controls were slowly ended and on april their statutory authorization lapsed
nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them he eliminated the cabinetlevel united states post office department which in became the governmentrun united states postal service
nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speech other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of and occupational safety and health administration osha the national environmental policy act required environmental impact statements for many federal projects nixon vetoed the clean water act of objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them which he deemed excessive after congress overrode his veto nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable
in nixon proposed health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandateb federalization of medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children and support for health maintenance organizations hmos a limited hmo bill was enacted in in nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandateb and replacement of medicaid by staterun health insurance plans available to all with incomebased premiums and cost sharing
concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among american soldiers in vietnam nixon called for a war on drugs pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities
as one policy initiative nixon called for more money for sicklecell research treatment and education in february and signed the national sickle cell anemia control act on may c while nixon called for increased spending on such highprofile items as sicklecell disease and for a war on cancer at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the national institutes of health
the nixon presidency witnessed the first largescale integration of public schools in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites hopeful of doing well in the south in he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then soon after his inauguration he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leadersboth white and blackto determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use
in addition to desegregating public schools nixon implemented the philadelphia plan in the first significant federal affirmative action program he also endorsed the equal rights amendment after it passed both houses of congress in and went to the states for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had
after a nearly decadelong national effort the united states won the race to land astronauts on the moon on july with the flight of apollo nixon spoke with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin during their moonwalk he called the conversation the most historic phone call ever made from the white house
nixon however was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the high level seen through the s as nasa prepared to send men to the moon nasa administrator thomas o paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the s and the launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as nixon however rejected both proposals due to the expense nixon also canceled the air force manned orbital laboratory program in because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more costeffective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective
on march nixon announced the end of the kennedyjohnson eras massive efforts in the space race stating we must think of space activities as part of a continuing process and not as a series of separate leaps each requiring a massive concentration of energy space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities what we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us he then cancelled the last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the space shuttle
on may nixon approved a fiveyear cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program culminating in the joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space
nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment the democratic solid south had long been a source of frustration to republican ambitions goldwater had won several southern states by opposing the civil rights act of but had alienated more moderate southerners nixons efforts to gain southern support in were diluted by wallaces candidacy through his first term he pursued a southern strategy with policies such as his desegregation plans that would be broadly acceptable among southern whites encouraging them to realign with the republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights era he nominated two southern conservatives clement haynsworth and g harrold carswell to the supreme court but neither was confirmed by the senate
nixon entered his name on the new hampshire primary ballot on january effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection virtually assured the republican nomination the president had initially expected his democratic opponent to be massachusetts senator ted kennedy brother of the late president but he was largely removed from contention after the chappaquiddick incident instead maine senator edmund muskie became the front runner with south dakota senator george mcgovern in a close second place
on june mcgovern won the california primary and secured the democratic nomination the following month nixon was renominated at the republican national convention he dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate missouri senator thomas eagleton dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle and was reelected on november in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history he defeated mcgovern with over percent of the popular vote losing only in massachusetts and the district of columbia
the term watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures the activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into democratic party headquarters at the watergate complex in washington dc on june the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relied on an informant known as deep throatlater revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbito link the men to the nixon administration nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading a series of revelations made it clear that the committee to reelect president nixon and later the white house was involved in attempts to sabotage the democrats senior aides such as white house counsel john dean faced prosecution in total officials were convicted of wrongdoing
in july white house aide alexander butterfield testified under oath to congress that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the oval office these tapes were subpoenaed by watergate special counsel archibald cox nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes citing executive privilege with the white house and cox at loggerheads nixon had cox fired in october in the saturday night massacre he was replaced by leon jaworski in november nixons lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the white house on june featured an minute gap rose mary woods the presidents personal secretary claimed responsibility for the gap alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape though her tale was widely mocked the gap while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the president cast doubt on nixons statement that he had been unaware of the coverup
though nixon lost much popular support even from his own party he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office he insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary did not break any laws and did not learn of the coverup until early on october vice president agnew resigned unrelated to watergate and was convicted on charges of bribery tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as governor of maryland nixon chose gerald ford minority leader of the house of representatives to replace agnew
on november during a televised question and answer session with the press nixon said people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got
the legal battle over the tapes continued through early and in april nixon announced the release of pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may which were televised on the major tv networks these hearings culminated in votes for impeachment on july the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released
the scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the president ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due and paid in back taxes in 
even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to fight the charges however one of the new tapes recorded soon after the breakin demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the smoking gun tape on august nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of white house involvement stating that he had a lapse of memory he met with republican congressional leaders soon after and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most only votes in his favor in the senate far fewer than the he needed to avoid removal from office
in light of his loss of political support and the nearcertainty of impeachment nixon resigned the office of the presidency on august after addressing the nation on television the previous evening the resignation speech was delivered from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy he defended his record as president quoting from theodore roosevelts speech citizenship in a republic
sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly
nixons speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had not admitted wrongdoing it was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office
following his resignation the nixons flew to their home la casa pacifica in san clemente california according to his biographer aitken after his resignation nixon was a soul in torment congress had funded nixons transition costs including some salary expenses though reducing the appropriation from to with some of his staff still with him nixon was at his desk by amwith little to do his former press secretary ron ziegler sat with him alone for hours each day
nixons resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished the ford white house considered a pardon of nixon though it would be unpopular in the country nixon contacted by ford emissaries was initially reluctant to accept the pardon but then agreed to do so ford however insisted on a statement of contrition nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document ford eventually agreed and on september he granted nixon a full free and absolute pardon which ended any possibility of an indictment nixon then released a statement
i was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with watergate particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy no words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over watergate have caused the nation and the presidency a nation i so deeply love and an institution i so greatly respect
in october nixon fell ill with phlebitis told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die a reluctant nixon chose surgery and president ford visited him in the hospital nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aidesdean haldeman and john ehrlichmanand the washington post disbelieving his illness printed a cartoon showing nixon with a cast on the wrong foot judge john sirica excused nixons presence despite the defendants objections congress instructed ford to retain nixons presidential papersbeginning a threedecade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate nixon was in the hospital when the midterm elections were held and watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the republican loss of seats in the house and three in the senate
in december nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable illwill against him in the country he wrote in his diary referring to himself and pat
so be it we will see it through weve had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now that is perhaps what we were made forto be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office this is a test of character and we must not fail the test
by early nixons health was improving he maintained an office in a coast guard station yards from his home at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day he mainly worked on his memoirs he had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly he was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in february which compelled him to part with many of his staff including ziegler in august of that year he met with british talkshow host and producer david frost who paid him for a series of sitdown interviews filmed and aired in they began on the topic of foreign policy recounting the leaders he had known but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on watergate nixon admitted that he had let down the country and that i brought myself down i gave them a sword and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish and i guess if id been in their position id have done the same thing the interviews garnered million viewersbecoming the mostwatched program of their kind in television history
the interviews helped improve nixons financial positionat one point in early he had only in the bankas did the sale of his key biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy nixon friends such as bebe rebozo in february nixon visited china at the personal invitation of mao nixon had wanted to return to china but chose to wait until after fords own visit in nixon remained neutral in the close primary battle between ford and reagan ford won but was defeated by georgia governor jimmy carter in the general election the carter administration had little use for nixon and blocked his planned trip to australia causing the government of prime minister malcolm fraser to withhold its official invitation
in nixon was disbarred in the state of new york for obstruction of justice in the watergate affair nixon chose not to present any defense in early nixon went to the united kingdom he was shunned by american diplomats and by most ministers of the james callaghan government he was welcomed however by the leader of the opposition margaret thatcher as well as by former prime ministers lord home and sir harold wilson two other former prime ministers harold macmillan and edward heath declined to meet him nixon addressed the oxford union regarding watergate

on july the richard nixon library and birthplace in yorba linda california opened as a private institution with the nixons in attendance they were joined by a large crowd of people including presidents ford reagan and george h w bush as well as their wives betty nancy and barbara in january the former president founded the nixon center today the center for the national interest a washington policy think tank and conference center

john f stacks of time magazine said of nixon shortly after his death
an outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every selfcreated disaster that he faced to reclaim a respected place in american public life after his resignation he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the worlds leaders and by the time bill clinton came to the white house in nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman clinton whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach nixon met openly with him and regularly sought his advice
tom wicker of the new york times noted that nixon had been equalled only by franklin roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and quoting nixons farewell speech wrote
richard nixons jowly beardshadowed face the skijump nose and the widows peak the arms upstretched in the vsign had been so often pictured and caricatured his presence had become such a familiar one in the land he had been so often in the heat of controversy that it was hard to realize the nation really would not have nixon to kick around anymore
ambrose said of the reaction to nixons death to everyones amazement except his hes our beloved elder statesman
upon nixons death almost all of the news coverage mentioned watergate but for the most part the coverage was favorable to the former president the dallas morning news stated history ultimately should show that despite his flaws he was one of our most farsighted chief executives this offended some columnist russell baker complained of a group conspiracy to grant him absolution cartoonist jeff koterba of the omaha worldherald depicted history before a blank canvas his subject nixon as america looks on eagerly the artist urges his audience to sit down the work will take some time to complete as this portrait is a little more complicated than most
historian and political scientist james macgregor burns observed of nixon how can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president so brilliant and so morally lacking nixons biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history according to ambrose nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished what he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional career suggests that he was remarkable among his congressional peers a success story in a troubled era one who steered a sensible anticommunist course against the excess of mccarthy aitken feels that nixon both as a man and as a statesman has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism no simple verdict is possible
nixons southern strategy is credited by some historians as causing the south to become a republican stronghold though others deem economic factors more important to the change throughout his career he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing soviet communism according to his biographer herbert parmet nixons role was to steer the republican party along a middle course somewhere between the competitive impulses of the rockefellers the goldwaters and the reagans
nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation historian paul charles milazzo in his paper on nixon and the environment points to nixons creation of the epa and his enforcement of legislation such as the endangered species act stating that though unsought and unacknowledged richard nixons environmental legacy is secure
nixon saw his policies regarding vietnam china and the soviets as key to his place in history george mcgovern nixons onetime opponent commented in president nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers china and the soviet union than any other president since world war ii with the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in vietnam nixon really will get high marks in history political scientist jussi m hanhimki disagrees saying nixons diplomacy was merely a continuation of the cold war policy of containment using diplomatic rather than military means historian christopher andrew concludes that nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena while the criminal farce of watergate was in the making nixons inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both communist china and the soviet union
historian keith w olson has written that nixon left a negative legacy fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in vietnam and watergate during the impeachment of bill clinton in both sides tried to use nixon and watergate to their advantage republicans suggested that clintons misconduct had been comparable to nixons while democrats contended that nixons actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent another legacy for a time was a decrease in the power of the presidency as congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of watergate olson suggests that grants of power to george w bush in the aftermath of the attacks restored the presidents power
nixons career was frequently dogged by his persona and the publics perception of it editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred he was often portrayed with unshaven jowls slumped shoulders and a furrowed sweaty brow
nixon had a complex personality both very secretive and awkward yet strikingly reflective about himself he was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects wearing a coat and tie even when home alone nixon biographer conrad black described him as being driven though also uneasy with himself in some ways according to black nixon
thought that he was doomed to be traduced doublecrossed unjustly harassed misunderstood underappreciated and subjected to the trials of job but that by the application of his mighty will tenacity and diligence he would ultimately prevail
biographer elizabeth drew summarized nixon as a smart talented man but most peculiar and haunted of presidents in his account of the nixon presidency author richard reeves described nixon as a strange man of uncomfortable shyness who functioned best alone with his thoughts nixons presidency was doomed by his personality reeves argues
he assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them he clung to the idea of being tough he thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness but that was what betrayed him he could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness
nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president even bebe rebozo by some accounts his closest friend did not call him by his first name nixon stated of this
even with close friends i dont believe in letting your hair down confiding this and that and the other thingsaying gee i couldnt sleep i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself thats just the way i am some people are different some people think its good therapy to sit with a close friend and you know just spill your guts and reveal their inner psychewhether they were breastfed or bottlefed not me no way
when told that most americans even at the end of his career did not feel they knew him nixon replied yeah its true and its not necessary for them to know
