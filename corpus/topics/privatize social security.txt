in the us social security is a social insurance program officially called oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi in reference to its three components due to projected difficulties with social security programs many have argued including former president bush that social security should be privatized at least partly this is a situation in which individuals are given subsidized personal accounts individual accounts or private accounts through partial privatization of the system
we believe every american deserves a secure healthy and dignified retirement during their working years americans contribute to social security in exchange for a promise that they will receive an income in retirement unlike those in the other party we will find a solution to protect social security for future generations we will block republican efforts to subject americans guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market through privatization we reject approaches that insist that cutting benefits is the only answer president obama will also make it easier for americans to save on their own for retirement and prepare for unforeseen expenses by participating in retirement accounts at work
democrats believe that social security and medicare must be kept strong for seniors people with disabilities and future generations our opponents have shown a shocking willingness to gut these programs to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest and we fundamentally reject that approach
while no changes should adversely affect any current or nearretiree comprehensive reform should address our societys remarkable medical advances in longevity and allow younger workers the option of creating their own personal investment accounts as supplements to the system younger americans have lost all faith in the social security system which is understandable when they read the non partisan actuarys reports about its future funding status born in an old industrial era beyond the memory of most americans it is long overdue for major change not just another legislative stopgap that postpones a day of reckoning to restore public trust in the system republicans are committed to setting it on a sound fiscal basis that will give workers control over and a sound return on their investments the sooner we act the sooner those close to retirement can be reassured of their benefits and younger workers can take responsibility for planning their own retirement decades from now
