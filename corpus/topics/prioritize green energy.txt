green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution green power is electricity generated from renewable energy sources
anaerobic digestion geothermal power wind power smallscale hydropower solar energy biomass power tidal power wave power and some forms of nuclear power ones which are able to burn nuclear waste through a process known as nuclear transmutation such as an integral fast reactor and therefore belong in the green energy category some definitions may also include power derived from the incineration of waste
democrats have supported increased domestic renewable energy development including wind and solar power farms in an effort to reduce carbon pollution the partys platform calls for an all of the above energy policy including clean energy natural gas and domestic oil with the desire of becoming energy independent the party has supported higher taxes on oil companies and increased regulations on coal power plants favoring a policy of reducing longterm reliance on fossil fuels additionally the party supports stricter fuel emissions standards to prevent air pollution
the republican party has called for a more aggressive strategy for their development especially for solar wind hydro tidal geothermal and biomass energy rather than focus on federal research however the party believes in marketbased research on the technology and partnerships between emerging renewable energy industries and current energy industries
over the past three or four years the partys stance on renewable energy has become stronger as it calls for the introduction of renewable energy resources into the mainstream one of its most unique strategies is the advocacy of longterm tax credit for renewable energy sources
