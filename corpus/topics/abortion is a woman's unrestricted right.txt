the issue of abortion is one of the most contentious and emotive dilemmas faced by modern societies the question is whether one should allow the termination of a pregnancy for some the question is even more fundamental at what stage is the embryo or fetus in the uterus to be regarded as a child at fertilization at birth or maybe somewhere between the battlelines are drawn between strict religious prolife arguments that it is never permissible and those prochoice that emphasise the womans right to choose as the primary concern while abortion has been legal in america since the landmark roe vs wade case in the early s this is by no means a reflection of universal agreement either international or within america itself as many western countries still have considerable restrictions on abortion for example the irish position has softened only recently and the catholic church steadfastly refuses to change its resolutely prolife stance in the face of criticism from womens and other lobbygroups
the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy including a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right abortion is an intensely personal decision between a woman her family her doctor and her clergy there is no place for politicians or government to get in the way we also recognize that health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions we strongly and unequivocally support a womans decision to have a child by providing affordable health care and ensuring the availability of and access to programs that help women during pregnancy and after the birth of a child including caring adoption programs
faithful to the selfevident truths enshrined in the declaration of independence we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed we support a human life amendment to the constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children we oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion or fund organizations which perform or advocate it and will not fund or subsidize health care which includes abortion coverage we support the appointment of judges who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life we oppose the nonconsensual withholding or withdrawal of care or treatment including food and water from people with disabilities including newborns as well as the elderly and infirm just as we oppose active and passive euthanasia and assisted suicide
