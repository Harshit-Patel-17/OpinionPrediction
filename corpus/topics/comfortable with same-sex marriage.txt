we support the right of all families to have equal respect responsibilities and protections under the law we support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for samesex couples we also support the freedom of churches and religious entities to decide how to administer marriage as a religious sacrament without government interference
we oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed samesex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples we support the full repeal of the socalled defense of marriage act and the passage of the respect for marriage act
congressional republicans took the lead in enacting the defense of marriage act affirming the right of states and the federal government not to recognize samesex relationships licensed in other jurisdictions the current administrations open defiance of this constitutional principlein its handling of immigration cases in federal personnel benefits in allowing a samesex marriage at a military base and in refusing to defend doma in the courtsmakes a mockery of the presidents inaugural oath we commend the united states house of representatives and state attorneys general who have defended these laws when they have been attacked in the courts we reaffirm our support for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman we applaud the citizens of the majority of states which have enshrined in their constitutions the traditional concept of marriage and we support the campaigns underway in several other states to do so
