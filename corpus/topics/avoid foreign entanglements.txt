after taking office president obama removed our combat brigades and ended our combat mission on a month timetable and after an interim period in which we continued to advise iraqis and conduct counterterrorism operations we completed the drawdown of all us troops last december this decision was reached after extensive discussions and with the full agreement of the iraqi government and it was determined to be in the best interest of both nations
