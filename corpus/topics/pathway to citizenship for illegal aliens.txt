in this country the rule of law guarantees equal treatment to every individual including more than one million immigrants to whom we grant permanent residence every year that is why we oppose any form of amnesty for those who intentionally violate the law granting amnesty only rewards and encourages more law breaking
we support the mandatory use of the systematic alien verification for entitlements save programan internetbased system that verifies the lawful presence of applicants
we insist upon enforcement at the workplace through verification systems so that jobs can be available to all legal workers use of the everify programan internetbased system that verifies the employment authorization and identity of employees must be made mandatory nationwide state enforcement efforts in the workplace must be welcomed not attacked when americans need jobs it is absolutely essential that we protect them from illegal labor in the workplace
