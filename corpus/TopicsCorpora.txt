abortion in the united states has been and remains one of the most controversial issues in united states culture and politics various antiabortion laws have been on the statute books of each state since at least in abortion was prohibited entirely in states and legal in limited circumstances such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest in other states in that year the supreme court in roe v wade invalidated all of these laws and set guidelines for the availability of abortion roe established that the right of privacy of a woman to obtain an abortion must be considered against important state interests in regulation roe established a trimester ie week threshold of state interest in the life of the fetus corresponding to its increasing viability likelihood of survival outside the uterus over the course of a pregnancy such that states were prohibited from banning abortion early in pregnancy but allowed to impose increasing restrictions or outright bans later in pregnancy that decision was modified by the case planned parenthood v casey which upheld the central holding in roe but replaced the trimester system with the point of fetal viability whenever it may occur as defining a states right to override the womans autonomy casey also lowered the legal standard to which states would be held in justifying restrictions imposed on a womans rights roe had held this to be strict scrutinythe traditional supreme court test for impositions upon fundamental constitutional rightswhereas casey created a new standard referring to undue burden specifically to balance the states and the womans interests in the case of abortion before roe v wade abortion was legal in several states but that decision imposed a uniform framework for state legislation on the subject it established a minimal period during which abortion must be legal under greater or lesser degrees of restriction throughout the pregnancy that basic framework modified in casey remains nominally in place although the effective availability of abortion varies significantly from state to state as many counties have no abortion providers in the united states the main actors in the abortion debate are most often labelled either as prochoice or prolife though shades of opinion exist and most americans are considered to be somewhere in the middle a gallupcom survey of adults found that opinions on abortion in the united states remain nearly evenly split with of participants identifying as prolife and identifying as prochoice the poll results also indicated that americans harbor a diverse and shifting set of opinions on the legal status of abortion in the us the survey polled that only of respondents believed abortion should be legal under any circumstances and of respondents believed that abortion should be legal under most or only a few circumstances recent polling results also found that only of americans were satisfied with abortion laws in the united states the abortion debate most commonly relates to the induced abortion of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy which is also how the term is used in a legal sense some also use the term elective abortion which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion whether or not she chooses to have one in medical parlance abortion can refer to either miscarriage or abortion until the fetus is viable after viability doctors call an abortion a termination of pregnancy when the united states first became independent most states applied english common law to abortion this meant it was not permitted after quickening or the start of fetal movements usually felt weeks after conception james wilson a framer of the us constitution explained the view as follows abortions became illegal by statute in britain in and various antiabortion statutes began to appear in the united states in the s that codified or expanded common law in a connecticut law targeted apothecaries who sold poisons to women for purposes of inducing an abortion and new york made postquickening abortions a felony and prequickening abortions a misdemeanor in some argue that the early american abortion laws were motivated not by ethical concerns about abortion but by concern about the procedures safety however some legal theorists point out that this theory is inconsistent with the fact that abortion was punishable regardless of whether any harm befell the pregnant woman and the fact that many of the early laws punished not only the doctor or abortionist but also the woman who hired them a number of other factors likely played a role in the rise of antiabortion laws in the united states physicians who were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws appear to have been motivated at least in part by advances in medical knowledge science had discovered that conception inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted moreover quickening was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step on a logical basis many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening ideologically the hippocratic oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion doctors were also influenced by practical reasons to impose antiabortion laws for one abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies in an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession these irregulars were considered a nuisance to public health the more formalized medical profession disliked the irregulars because they were competition often at a cheaper costa despite campaigns to end the practice of abortion abortifacient advertising was highly effective in the united states though less so across the atlantic contemporary estimates of midth century abortion rates in the united states suggest between of all pregnancies in the united states during that era ended in abortion this era saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions before the start of the th century most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant out of wedlock out of abortion cases published in american medical journals between and over half were sought by married women and well over of the married women already had at least one child the sense that married women were now frequently obtaining abortions worried many conservative physicians who were almost exclusively men in the postcivil war era much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning womens rights movement though the medical profession expressed hostility toward feminism many feminists of the era were opposed to abortion in the revolution operated by elizabeth cady stanton and susan b anthony an anonymous contributor signing a wrote in about the subject arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion the root cause must also be addressed simply passing an antiabortion law would the writer stated be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed while the root remains no matter what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed it will burden her conscience in life it will burden her soul in death but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime to many feminists of this era abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men even the free love wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate for abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort as men did not respect womens right to abstinence however physicians remained the loudest voice in the antiabortion debate and they carried their antifeminist agenda to state legislatures around the country advocating not only antiabortion laws but also laws against birth control this movement presaged the modern debate over womens body rights a campaign was launched against the movement and the use and availability of contraceptives criminalization of abortion accelerated from the late s through the efforts of concerned legislators doctors and the american medical association in anthony comstock created the new york society for the suppression of vice an institution dedicated to supervising the morality of the public later that year comstock successfully influenced the united states congress to pass the comstock law which made it illegal to deliver through the us mail any obscene lewd or lascivious material it also prohibited producing or publishing information pertaining to the procurement of abortionor the prevention of conception or venereal disease even to medical students the production publication importation and distribution of such materials was suppressed under the comstock law as being obscene and similar prohibitions were passed by of the states in abortion was a felony in every state some states included provisions allowing for abortion in limited circumstances generally to protect the womans life or to terminate pregnancies arising from rape or incest abortions continued to occur however and became increasingly available the american birth control league was founded by margaret sanger in to promote the founding of birth control clinics enable women to control their own fertility and promote eugenics by the s licensed physicians performed an estimated abortions a year in gerri santoro of connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the prochoice movement some womens rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere as an example in chicago a group known as jane operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the s women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find jane in the us supreme court case griswold v connecticut struck down one of the remaining contraception comstock laws in connecticut and massachusetts however griswold only applied to marital relationships eisenstadt v baird extended its holding to unmarried persons as well following griswold case the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog issued a medical bulletin accepting a recommendation from years earlier which clarified that conception is implantation not fertilization and consequently birth control methods that prevented implantation became classified as contraceptives not abortifacients in colorado became the first state to decriminalize abortion in cases of rape incest or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman similar laws were passed in california oregon and north carolina in hawaii became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman and new york repealed its law and allowed abortions up to the th week of pregnancy similar laws were soon passed in alaska and washington a law in washington dc which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman was challenged in the supreme court in in united states v vuitch the court upheld the law deeming that health meant psychological and physical wellbeing essentially allowing abortion in washington dc by the end of states had a law similar to that of colorado while mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and alabama and massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the womans physical health was endangered in order to obtain abortions during this period women would often travel from a state where abortion was illegal to states where it was legal the legal position prior to roe v wade was that abortion was illegal in states and legal under certain circumstances in states in the late s a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion in the national conference of catholic bishops assigned monsignor james t mchugh to document efforts to reform abortion laws and antiabortion groups began forming in various states in in mchugh led an advisory group which became the national right to life committee the forerunner of the naral prochoice america was formed in to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion following roe v wade in late naral became the national abortion rights action league in deciding roe v wade on january the supreme court ruled that a texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional the court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the right to privacy in the sense of the right of a person not to be encroached by the state in its opinion it listed several landmark cases where the court had previously found a right to privacy implied by the constitution the court did not recognize a right to abortion in all cases state regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications if the state is interested in protecting fetal life after viability it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother the court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion the court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability a point to be determined by the abortion doctor after viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons which the court defined broadly to include psychological wellbeing a central issue in the roe case and in the wider abortion debate in general is whether human life or personhood begins at conception birth or at some point in between the court declined to make an attempt at resolving this issue noting we need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins when those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer instead it chose to point out that historically under english and american common law and statutes the unborn have never been recognizedas persons in the whole sense and thus the fetuses are not legally entitled to the protection afforded by the right to life specifically enumerated in the fourteenth amendment so rather than asserting that human life begins at any specific point the court simply declared that the state has a compelling interest in protecting potential life at the point of viability under roe v wade state governments may not prohibit late terminations of pregnancy when necessary to preserve the womans life or health even if it would cause the demise of a viable fetus this rule was clarified by the judicial decision doe v bolton which specifies that the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age relevant to the wellbeing of the patient it is by this provision for the mothers mental health that women in the us legally choose abortion after viability when screenings reveal abnormalities that do not cause a baby to die shortly after birth jane roe of the landmark roe v wade lawsuit whose real name is norma mccorvey is now a prolife advocate mccorvey writes that she never had the abortion and became the pawn of two young and ambitious lawyers who were looking for a plaintiff who they could use to challenge the texas state law prohibiting abortion however attorney linda coffee says she does not remember mccorvey having any hesitancy about wanting an abortion mary doe of the companion doe v bolton lawsuit the mother of three whose real name is sandra cano maintains that she never wanted or had an abortion and that she is ninetynine percent certain that she did not sign the affidavit to initiate the suit in the case of planned parenthood v casey the court abandoned roes strict trimester framework instead adopting the standard of undue burden for evaluating state abortion restrictions but reemphasized the right to abortion as grounded in the general sense of liberty and privacy protected under the constitution constitutional protection of the womans decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment it declares that no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the controlling word in the cases before us is liberty the supreme court continues to grapple with cases on the subject on april it issued a ruling in the case of gonzales v carhart involving a federal law entitled the partialbirth abortion ban act of which president george w bush had signed into law the law banned intact dilation and extraction which opponents of abortion rights referred to as partialbirth abortion and stipulated that anyone breaking the law would get a prison sentence up to years the united states supreme court upheld the ban by a narrow majority of marking the first time the court has allowed a ban on any type of abortion since the opinion which came from justice anthony kennedy was joined by justices antonin scalia clarence thomas and the two recent appointees samuel alito and chief justice john roberts in the case of whole womans health v hellerstedt the supreme court in a decision on june swept away forms of state restrictions on the way abortion clinics can function the texas legislature enacted in restrictions on the delivery of abortions services that created an undue burden for women seeking an abortion by requiring abortion doctors to have difficulttoobtain admitting privileges at a local hospital and by requiring clinics to have costly hospitalgrade facilities the court struck down these two provisions facially from the law at issue that is the very words of the provisions were invalid no matter how they might be applied in any practical situation according the supreme court the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a womans right to abortion belongs with the courts and not the legislatures since led by congressional republicans the us house of representatives and us senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure of intact dilation and extraction commonly known as partial birth abortion such measures passed twice by wide margins but president bill clinton vetoed those bills in april and october on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions congressional supporters of the bill argue that a health exception would render the bill unenforceable since the doe v bolton decision defined health in vague terms justifying any motive for obtaining an abortion congress was unsuccessful with subsequent attempts to override the vetoes the bornalive infants protection act of baipa was enacted august by an act of congress and signed into law by george w bush it asserts the human rights of infants born after a failed attempt to induce abortion a bornalive infant is specified as a person human being child individual born alive is defined as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat pulsation of the umbilical cord breath or voluntary muscle movement no matter if the umbilical cord has been cut or if the expulsion of the infant was natural induced labor cesarean section or induced abortion on october with a vote of the house approved the partialbirth abortion ban act to ban partialbirth abortion with an exemption in cases of fatal threats to the woman through this legislation a doctor could face up to two years in prison and civil lawsuits for performing such a procedure a woman undergoing the procedure could not be prosecuted under the measure on october the united states senate passed the bill by a vote of with a number of democrats joining in support the bill was signed by president george w bush on november but a federal judge blocked its enforcement in several states just a few hours after it became public law the supreme court upheld the nationwide ban on the procedure in the case gonzales v carhart on april signaling a substantial change in the courts approach to abortion law the ruling said the partial birth abortion ban act does not conflict with previous decisions regarding abortion the current judicial interpretation of the us constitution regarding abortion in the united states following the supreme court of the united statess landmark decision in roe v wade and subsequent companion decisions is that abortion is legal but may be restricted by the states to varying degrees states have passed laws to restrict late term abortions require parental notification for minors and mandate the disclosure of abortion risk information to patients prior to the procedure the key deliberated article of the us constitution is the fourteenth amendment which states that the official report of the us senate judiciary committee issued in after extensive hearings on the human life amendment proposed by senators orrin hatch and thomas eagleton stated what substantially remains true today one aspect of the legal abortion regime now in place has been determining when the fetus is viable outside the womb as a measure of when the life of the fetus is its own and therefore subject to being protected by the state in the majority opinion delivered by the court in roe v wade viability was defined as potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid viability is usually placed at about seven months weeks but may occur earlier even at weeks when the court ruled in the thencurrent medical technology suggested that viability could occur as early as weeks advances over the past three decades have allowed fetuses that are a few weeks less than weeks old to survive outside the womans womb these scientific achievements while lifesaving for premature babies have made the determination of being viable somewhat more complicatedcitation needed as of update the youngest child to survive a premature birth in the united states was a girl born at kapiolani medical center in honolulu hawaii at weeks and days gestation because of the split between federal and state law legal access to abortion continues to vary by state geographic availability varies dramatically with percent of us counties having no abortion provider moreover due to the hyde amendment many state health programs do not cover abortions currently states including california illinois and new york offer or require such coverage the legality of abortion in the united states is frequently a major issue in nomination battles for the us supreme court nominees typically remain silent on the issue during their hearings as the issue may come before them as judges the unborn victims of violence act commonly known as laci and conners law was passed by congress and signed into law by president bush on april allowing two charges to be filed against someone who kills a pregnant mother one for the mother and one for the fetus it specifically bans charges against the mother andor doctor relating to abortion procedures nevertheless it has generated much controversy among prochoice advocates who view it as a potential step in the direction of banning abortion various states have laws on abortion some of which refer to it as feticide on march south dakota governor mike rounds signed into law a prolife statute that made performing abortions a felony which was subsequently repealed in a november referendum on february mississippis house public health committee voted to approve a ban on abortion and that bill died after the house and senate failed to agree on compromise legislation several states have enacted trigger laws which would take effect if roe v wade is overturned north dakota hb or the personhood of children act which passed the north dakota house of representatives on february but was later defeated in the north dakota senate aimed to allocate rights to the preborn partially born and if passed would likely have been used to challenge roe v wade on february the virginia house of delegates passed house bill in a vote of that effectively outlaws all virginia abortions by declaring that the rights of persons apply from the moment sperm and egg unite it also passed a second bill in a vote that requires women to have a transvaginal ultrasound before undergoing abortions some states have sought to ban abortion by means of an amendment to the state constitution three of which have reached the ballot for a vote colorado citizens voted on amendment on november but it failed to pass with voting against it and voting for it a similar initiative amendment made the colorado ballot on november where it failed again this time to on november initiative a personhood measure that would have banned all abortions and some forms of contraception was defeated on the mississippi ballot voting no to all three of these amendments made it to the ballot through a citizen initiative process as opposed to being referred to the ballot by their state legislatures these amendments dubbed personhood amendments have contained farreaching language that go beyond simply banning abortion they define personhood as beginning from the moment of conception or fertilization which would potentially outlaw forms of birth control in addition to potentially banning invitro fertilization the umbrella organization personhood usa based in colorado and cofounded by cal zastrow and keith mason was responsible for getting amendments and onto the ballot in colorado personhood usa also plans on pushing for such amendments in montana and oregon other states are considering personhood amendments banning abortion some through legislative methods and others through citizen initiative campaigns among these states are florida ohio georgia texas and arkansas in kansas became the first state to ban the dilation and evacuation procedure a common secondtrimester abortion procedure  states have mandatory counseling and delay periods while states require in person counseling  abortion in the northern mariana islands a united states commonwealth is illegal qualifying requirements for performing abortions vary from state to state currently california oregon montana vermont and new hampshire allow qualified nonphysician health professionals such as physicians assistants nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives to do firsttrimester aspiration abortions and to prescribe drugs for medical abortions washington state new mexico illinois alaska maryland new york massachusetts connecticut and new jersey allow qualified nonphysicians to prescribe drugs for medical abortions only in all other states only licensed physicians may perform abortions in the fda issued new guidelines recommending that qualified nonphysician healthcare professionals be allowed to prescribe mifepristone in all states however these guidelines are not binding and states are free to determine their own policies regarding mifepristone because reporting of abortions is not mandatory statistics are of varying reliability the centers for disease control cdc regularly compiles these statistics the annual number of legal induced abortions in the united states doubled between and and peaked in there was a slow but steady decline through the s overall the number of annual abortions decreased by between and with temporary spikes in and  by abortion rate in the united states dropped to its lowest point since the supreme court legalized the procedure according to a study performed by guttmacher institute longacting contraceptive methods were having a significant impact in reducing unwanted pregnancies there were fewer than abortions for every women of childbearing age that was a percent decrease from s numbers and slightly higher than the rate in when the supreme courts roe v wade decision legalized abortion the study indicated a longterm decline in the abortion rate the rate has dropped significantly from its alltime high in when there were roughly abortions for every women of reproductive age the overall number of abortions also fell percent from to nearly million in in the centers for disease control and prevention also reported a decline in abortion rates even though abortion is legal abortion can carry heavy social stigma for this reason incidence of abortions may be difficult to measure because in medicine they can be reported variously as miscarriage induced miscarriage menstrual regulation miniabortion and regulation of a delayedsuspended menstruation a guttmacher institute survey of abortion providers estimated that early medical abortions accounted for of all nonhospital abortions and slightly over onequarter of abortions before weeks gestation in the united states in medical abortions voluntarily reported to the cdc by reporting areas excluding alabama california connecticut delaware florida hawaii illinois louisiana maryland massachusetts nebraska nevada new hampshire pennsylvania tennessee vermont wisconsin and wyoming and published in its annual abortion surveillance reports have increased every year since the september fda approval of mifepristone ru in in in in in in in in in in of those at less than weeks gestation medical abortions accounted for of first trimester abortions at planned parenthood clinics in the united states in  abortion is common among religiously identified women according to the guttmacher institute more than in us women obtaining an abortion report a religious affiliation protestant catholic and other and attend religious services at least once a month the abortion rate for protestant women is per women while catholic women have a slightly higher rate per  abortion rates tend to be higher among minority women in the us in due to lower access to healthcare and contraception the rates among black and hispanic women were per and per respectively vs per among nonhispanic white women note that this figure includes all women of reproductive age including women that are not pregnant in other words these abortion rates reflect the rate at which us women of reproductive age have an abortion each year while white women obtain of all abortions african american women are three times more likely to have an abortion in the rates of abortion by ethnicity in the us were abortions per black women abortions per hispanic women and abortions per white women another study in revealed that in to women reported the following as their primary reasons for choosing an abortion the source of this information takes findings into account from nations including the united states and therefore these findings may not be typical for any one nation according to a study that included specific data about late abortions ie abortions at or more weeks gestation women reported that various reasons contributed to their having a late abortion in cases of rape or incest accounted for of abortions a study by the guttmacher institute reported that women listed the following amongst their reasons for choosing to have an abortion a national survey of family growth nsfg shows that rates of unintended pregnancy are highest among blacks hispanics and women with lower socioeconomic status according to the centers for disease control in most abortions were performed by weeks gestation and nearly all were performed by weeks gestation few abortions were performed between weeks gestation or at weeks gestation from to the percentage of all abortions performed at weeks gestation increased  in the us a woman is at greater risk of death from childbirth than from abortion for pregnancies terminated at or before weeks gestation leading up to the th anniversary of the roe v wade supreme court decision in january a majority of americans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases according to a poll by nbc news and the wall street journal as well approximately of respondents oppose roe v wade being overturned which is the highest percentage on this question since a poll by the pew research center yielded similar results moreover of republicans opposed overturning roe compared to who supported overturning it gallup notes that abortion attitudes are shifting gallup declared in may that more americans identifying as prolife is the new normal while also noting that there had been no increase in opposition to abortion it suggested that political polarization may have prompted more republicans to call themselves prolife the terms prochoice and prolife do not always reflect a political view or fall along a binary in one public religion research institute poll seven in ten americans described themselves as prochoice while almost twothirds described themselves as prolife the same poll found that of americans were in favor of legal access to abortion in all or some cases pew research center polling shows little change in views from to modest differences based on gender or age the original articles table also shows by party affiliation religion and education level a january cbs newsnew york times poll examined whether americans thought abortion should be legal or not and found variations in opinion which depended upon party affiliation and the region of the country the margin of error is for questions answered of the entire sample overall figures and may be higher for questions asked of subgroups all other figures a cnnusa todaygallup poll in january asked about the legality of abortion by trimester using the question do you think abortion should generally be legal or generally illegal during each of the following stages of pregnancy this same question was also asked by gallup in march and july polls indicates general support of abortion during the first trimester although support drops dramatically for abortion during the second and third trimester according to gallups longtime polling on abortion the majority of americans are neither strictly prolife or prochoice it depends upon circumstances gallup polling from to consistently reveals that when asked the question do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances americans repeatedly answer legal only under certain circumstances according to the poll in any given year say legal only under certain circumstances for say legal under any circumstances for and illegal in all circumstances for with having no opinion for  do you think abortions should be legal under any circumstances legal only under certain circumstances or illegal in all circumstances according to the aforementioned poll americans differ drastically based upon situation of the pregnancy suggesting they do not support unconditional abortions based on two separate polls taken may of and respondents respectively americans stated their approval for abortion under these various circumstances another separate trio of polls taken by gallup in and revealed public support for abortion as follows for the given criteria gallup furthermore established public support for many issues supported by the prolife community and opposed by the prochoice community an october cbs news poll explored under what circumstances americans believe abortion should be allowed asking the question what is your personal feeling about abortion the results were as follows partialbirth abortion is a nonmedical term for a procedure called intact dilation and extraction used by those who oppose the procedure a rasmussen reports poll four days after the supreme courts opinion in gonzales v carhart found that of respondents knew the ruling allowed states to place some restrictions on specific abortion procedures of those who knew of the decision agreed with the decision and were opposed an abc poll from found that of respondents thought partialbirth abortion should be illegal a similar number of respondents wanted an exception if it would prevent a serious threat to the womans health additional polls from found between in favor of banning this type of abortion and between opposed gallup has repeatedly queried the american public on this issue as seen on its abortion page the abortion debate has also been extended to the question of who pays the medical costs of the procedure with some states using the mechanism as a way of reducing the number of abortions the cost of an abortion varies depending on factors such as location facility timing and type of procedure in a nonhospital abortion at weeks gestation ranged from to average whereas an abortion at weeks gestation ranged from to average costs are higher for a medical abortion than a firsttrimester surgical abortion the hyde amendment is a federal legislative provision barring the use of federal medicaid funds to pay for abortions except for rape and incest the provision in various forms was in response to roe v wade and has been routinely attached to annual appropriations bills since and represented the first major legislative success by the prolife movement the law requires that states cover abortions under medicaid in the event of rape incest and life endangerment based on the federal law though members of both major political parties come down on either side of the issue the republican party is often seen as being prolife since the official party platform opposes abortion and considers unborn children to have an inherent right to life republicans for choice represents the minority of that party in pollsters found that of republicans favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances of republican national convention delegates in believed that abortion should be generally available and believed that it should not be permitted the same poll showed that of all republican voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it while believed that it should not be permitted the democratic party platform considers abortion to be a womans right democrats for life of america represents the minority of that party in pollsters found that of democrats favor the availability of abortion in most circumstances however a zogby international poll in found that of all democrats believed that abortion destroys a human life and is manslaughter of democratic national convention delegates in believed that abortion should be generally available and believed that abortion should not be permitted the same poll showed that of all democratic voters believed that abortion should be generally available to those who want it while believed that it should not be permitted the green party of the united states supports abortion as a womans right the libertarian party platform states that government should be kept out of the matter leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration abortion is a contentious issue among libertarians and the marylandbased organization libertarians for life opposes the legality of abortion in most circumstances in the united states the abortion issue has become deeply politicized in of state democratic platforms supported the right to having an abortion while of state republican platforms opposed it this divergence also led to christian right organizations like christian voice christian coalition and moral majority having an increasingly strong role in the republican party this opposition has been extended under the foreign assistance act in jesse helms introduced an amendment banning the use of aid money to promote abortion overseas and in the mexico city policy prohibited financial support to any overseas organization that performed or promoted abortions the mexico city policy was revoked by president bill clinton and subsequently reinstated by president george w bush president barack obama overruled this policy by executive order on january  the official platforms of the major political parties in the us are as follows the risk of death due to legal abortion has fallen considerably since legalization in due to increased physician skills improved medical technology and earlier termination of pregnancy from through deaths of pregnant women during abortion fell from nearly to a little over according to the centers for disease control the number of women who died in from illegal abortion was thirtynine in dr mary calderone a former director of planned parenthood said the roe effect is an hypothesis which suggests that since supporters of abortion rights cause the erosion of their own political base by having fewer children the practice of abortion will eventually lead to the restriction or illegalization of abortion the legalized abortion and crime effect is another controversial theory that posits legal abortion reduces crime because unwanted children are more likely to become criminals since roe v wade there have been numerous attempts to reverse the decision in the election season mississippi placed an amendment on the ballot that redefine how the state viewed abortion the personhood amendment defined personhood as every human being from the moment of fertilization cloning or the functional equivalent thereof if passed it would have been illegal to get an abortion in the state on july a mississippi federal judge ordered an extension of his temporary order to allow the states only abortion clinic to stay open the order will stay in place until us district judge daniel porter jordan iii can review newly drafted rules on how the mississippi department of health will administer a new abortion law the law in question came into effect on july  although it is uncommon women sometimes give birth in spite of an attempted abortion reporting of livebirth after attempted abortion may not be consistent from state to state but were recorded in one study in upstate new york in the twoandahalf years before roe v wade under the bornalive infants protection act of medical staff must report live birth if they observe any breathing heartbeat umbilical cord pulsation or confirmed voluntary muscle movement regardless of gestational age to ensure the success of the abortion procedure doctors are advised to induce fetal death before abortion procedures after weeks gestation especially when performing induced labor abortion 
the right to keep and bear arms in the united states is a fundamental right protected by the second amendment to the united states constitution part of the bill of rights and by the constitutions of most us states the second amendment declares a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed in the united states which has an english common law tradition the concept of a right to keep and bear arms was recognized prior to the creation of a written national constitution when colonists in the thirteen colonies rebelled against british control during the american revolution they cited the english bill of rights as an example the american understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced by the english bill of rights an act of parliament which also dealt with personal defence by english subjects the bill of rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed king james ii a roman catholic who had forced the disarming of protestants while arming and deploying armed catholics contrary to law among other alleged violations of individual rights the bill of rights provided that protestants could bear arms for their defence as permitted by law it also established that the power to regulate the right to bear arms belonged to parliament not the monarch sir william blackstone wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the natural right of resistance and selfpreservation but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law the fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject that i shall at present mention is that of having arms for their defence suitable to their condition and degree and such as are allowed by law which is also declared by the same statute and is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions of the natural right of resistance and selfpreservation when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression in united states v cruikshank the us supreme court recognized that the right to arms preexisted the constitution and in that case and in presser v illinois recognized that the second amendment protected the right from being infringed by congress in united states v miller the court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held and citing the tennessee case of aymette v state indicated that it protected the right to keep and bear arms that are part of the ordinary military equipment or the use of which could contribute to the common defense in its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the second amendment protects district of columbia v heller the court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation not contingent on service in a militia while indicating in dicta that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster in the case of mcdonald v chicago the court applied incorporation doctrine to extend the second amendments protections nationwide the peoples right to have their own arms for their defense is described in the philosophical and political writings of aristotle cicero john locke machiavelli the english whigs and othersneed quotation to verify though possessing arms appears to be distinct from bearing them the possession of arms is recognized as necessary for and a logical precursor to the bearing of arms don kates a civil liberties lawyer cites historic english usage describing the right to keep and bear their private arms likewise sayoko blodgettford notes a nonmilitary usage of the phrase in pamphlet widely circulated by the dissenting minority dating from the time of the pennsylvania ratifying convention for the us constitution the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state or the united states or the purpose of killing game and no law shall be passed for disarming the people or any of them unless for crimes committed in commentary written by judge garwood in united states v emerson the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit concluded in that there are numerous instances of the phrase bear arms being used to describe a civilians carrying of arms early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the people or citizen or citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves or himself and the state or equivalent words thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage bear arms was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service see bliss v commonwealth am dec ky ky  similarly in a released senate report on the right to keep and bear arms senator orrin hatch chairman us senate judiciary committee subcommittee on the constitution states they argue that the second amendments words right of the people mean a right of the state apparently overlooking the impact of those same words when used in the first and fourth amendments the right of the people to assemble or to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is not contested as an individual guarantee still they ignore consistency and claim that the right to bear arms relates only to military uses this not only violates a consistent constitutional reading of right of the people but also ignores that the second amendment protects a right to keep arms when our ancestors forged a land conceived in liberty they did so with musket and rifle when they reacted to attempts to dissolve their free institutions and established their identity as a free nation they did so as a nation of armed freemen when they sought to record forever a guarantee of their rights they devoted one full amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their right to keep and bear arms against governmental interference under my chairmanship the subcommittee on the constitution will concern itself with a proper recognition of and respect for this right most valued by free men likewise the us supreme court ruled in district of columbia v heller no that the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as selfdefense within the home some historians have argued that prior to and through the th century the expression bear arms appeared exclusively in military contexts as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians in lateeighteenthcentury parlance bearing arms was a term of art with an obvious military and legal connotation as a review of the library of congresss data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and early national periods reveals the thirty uses of bear arms and bearing arms in bills statutes and debates of the continental confederation and united states congresses between and invariably occur in a context exclusively focused on the army or the militia however this conclusion is disputed and may be due to selection bias which arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service commenting on this previous research other historians note searching more comprehensive collections of english language works published before shows that there are a number of uses thathave nothing to do with military serviceand the common law was in agreement edward christians edition of blackstones commentaries that appeared in s described the rights of englishmen which every american colonist had been promised in these terms everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun if he does not use it for the unlawful destruction of game this right was separate from militia duties the oxford english dictionary defines the term to bear arms as to serve as a soldier do military service fight dating to about  garry wills author and history professor at northwestern university has written of the origin of the term bear arms by legal and other channels the latin arma ferre entered deeply into the european language of war bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war that shakespeare can call a just war justborne arms and a civil war selfborne arms even outside the special phrase bear arms much of the nouns use echoes latin phrases to be under arms sub armis the call to arms ad arma to follow arms arma sequi to take arms arma capere to lay down arms arma pnere arms is a profession that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church an issue undergoes the arbitrament of arms one does not bear arms against a rabbit garry wills also cites greek and latin etymology  bear arms refers to military service which is why the plural is used based on greek hopla pherein and latin arma ferre one does not bear arm or bear an arm the word means etymologically equipment from the root ar in verbs like ararisko to fit out it refers to the equipage of war thus bear arms can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare since the profession of arms refers to all military callings historically the right to keep and bear arms whether considered an individual or a collective or a militia right did not originate fully formed in the bill of rights in rather the second amendment was the codification of the sixcenturiesold responsibility to keep and bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the english colonists that settled north america tracing its origin back to the assize of arms of that occurred during the reign of henry ii through being codified in the united states constitution the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the people and statutory law enacted subsequently by congress cannot extinguish the preexisting common law right to keep and bear arms the second amendment to the united states constitution refers to a preexisting right to keep and bear arms a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the right is often presented in the united states as being an unenumerated preexisting right such as provided for by the ninth amendment to the united states constitution interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated rights and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people some have seen the second amendment as derivative of a common law right to keep and bear arms thomas b mcaffee michael j quinlan writing in the north carolina law review march page have stated madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the second amendmentthe right was preexisting at both common law and in the early state constitutions akhil reed amar similarly notes the basis of common law for the first ten amendments of the us constitution following john randolph tuckers famous oral argument in the chicago anarchist case spies v illinois though originally the first ten amendments were adopted as limitations on federal power yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights common law rights of the man they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the united states uviller and merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the state but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state they also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the constitution has ceased to exist in the united states resulting from deliberate congressional legislation and also societal neglect nonetheless technically all males aged seventeen to fortyfive are members of the unorganized militia but that status has no practical legal significance a few academic writers published their opinions in several works from the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic regarding arms and liberty it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the principal purpose of the amendment was to secure a personal individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms we cannot however as the individual rights contingent generally does disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state we understand the second amendment as though it read inasmuch as and so long as a well regulated militia shall be necessary to the security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the maintenance thereof the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed to us the language of the amendment cannot support a right to personal weaponry independent of the social value of a regulated organization of armed citizens in the century following the ratification of the bill of rights the intended meaning and application of the second amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times the vast majority of regulation was done by states and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the second amendment a notable exception to this general rule was houston v moore us where the supreme court mentioned the second amendment in an aside in the nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves prior to the civil war and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these individuals most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the court case dred scott v sandford whether the slave dred scott could be a citizen with rights including the right to bear arms this debate about the rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term bear arms with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess firearms in the dred scott decision the opinion of the court stated that if african americans were considered us citizens it would give to persons of the negro race who were recognized as citizens in any one state of the union the rightto keep and carry arms wherever they went the second amendment of the united states constitution is a federal provision in this fundamental and individual right was fully incorporated with the th amendment per the scotus ruling made in mcdonald vs city of chicago which upheld the prior opinion made in heller vs district of colombia each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution fortyfour states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into its state constitution each of the state constitutions state laws and state courts address the statebased right to bear arms distinctly within their respective jurisdictions the degree and the nature of the protection prohibition and regulation at the state level varies from state to state the district of columbia not being a state falls within the federal jurisdiction approximately thirtyone states have explicitly chosen to include the right to arms for individual right defense of self defense of home or similarly worded reasons approximately thirteen states as with the us constitution did not choose to explicitly include individual self or home wording associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states approximately twentyeight states have explicitly chosen to include the right to bear arms for security of a free state defense of state common defense or similarly worded reasons as with the us constitution approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly free state defense of state or common defense wording for their specific state whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether implicit individual rights exist or whether such rights if any are implicitly protected by the states constitutions or by the us constitutions second amendment remains a matter of dispute however since the scotus has fully incorporated the d and th amendments in their opinion and order in mcdonald vs city of chicago the right to keep and bear arms is fully applicable to the states and limits the states on anyandall regulations and restrictions they choose to take and federal constitutional rights take precedent over state local and other laws that regulate to right of lawful citizens to keep and bear arms for selfdefense a central component of the nd amendment see mcdonald vs city of chicago sc  regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal constitutional rights to bear arms state courts have addressed the meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail two different models have emerged from state jurisprudence an individual right defense of self or home and a collective defense of the state right it should be noted however that the states cannot lessen or restrict any bill of rights guarantee that has been fully incorporated american jurisprudence and that the right that is fully incorporated also applies to the respective state constitutions again the states can only addto these rights but can never diminish these rights by state and local laws bliss v commonwealth ky addressed the right to bear arms pursuant to art sec of the second constitution of kentucky that the right of the citizens to bear arms in defence of themselves and the state shall not be questioned this was interpreted to include the right to carry a concealed sword in a cane this case has been described as about a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons that was violative of the second amendment others however have seen no conflict with the second amendment by the commonwealth of kentuckys statute under consideration in bliss since the kentucky law was aimed at concealed weapons no one saw any conflict with the second amendment as a matter of fact most of the few people who considered the question at all believed amendments to the us constitution did not apply to state laws the kentucky high court stated in bliss but it should not be forgotten that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution it is the right entire and complete as it existed at the adoption of the constitution and if any portion of that right be impaired immaterial how small the part may be and immaterial the order of time at which it be done it is equally forbidden by the constitution the constitution mentioned in this quote refers to kentuckys constitution the case prompted outrage in the kentucky house all the while recognizing that section of the second constitution of kentucky did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms the bliss ruling to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons was overturned by constitutional amendment with section in kentuckys third constitution banning the future carrying of concealed weapons while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the commonwealth of kentucky this recognition has remained to the present day in the commonwealth of kentuckys fourth constitution enacted in in section article that guarantees the right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the state subject to the power of the general assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons as noted in the northern kentucky law review second amendment symposium rights in conflict in the s vol no p the first state court decision resulting from the right to bear arms issue was bliss v commonwealth the court held that the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state must be preserved entire this holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified the importance of bliss is also seen from the defense subsequently given against a murder charge in kentucky against mattews ward who in pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brothers teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class wards defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers including us senator john crittenden former governor of kentucky and former united states attorney general the defense successfully defended ward in through an assertion that a man has a right to carry arms i am aware of nothing in the laws of god or man prohibiting it the constitution of kentucky and our bill of rights guarantee it the legislature once passed an act forbidding it but it was decided unconstitutional and overruled by our highest tribunal the court of appeals as noted by cornell wards lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in bliss and wrapped their clients action under the banner of a constitutional right to bear arms ward was acquitted aymette v state tenn in aymette the tennessee supreme court construed the guarantee in tennessees constitution that the free white men of this state have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as the federal constitutions second amendment the court wrote the words bear arms have reference to their military use and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress as the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured is of general and public nature to be exercised by the people in a body for their common defense so the arms the right to keep which is secured are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare and that constitute the ordinary military equipment the georgia supreme court ruled in nunn v georgia nunn v state ga kel that a state law banning handguns was an unconstitutional violation of the second amendment this was the first gun control measure to be overturned on second amendment grounds the supreme court in its ruling in heller v district of columbia said nunn perfectly captured the way in which the operative clause of the second amendment furthered the purpose announced in the prefatory clause the right of the whole people old and young men women and boys and not militia only to keep and bear arms of every description and not such merely as are used by the militia shall not be infringed curtailed or broken in upon in the smallest degree and all this for the important end to be attained the rearing up and qualifying a wellregulated militia so vitally necessary to the security of a free state our opinion is that any law state or federal is repugnant to the constitution and void which contravenes this right originally belonging to our forefathers trampled under foot by charles i and his two wicked sons and successors reestablished by the revolution of conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own magna charta in state v buzzard ark the arkansas high court adopted a militiabased political interpretation reading of the right to bear arms under state law and upheld the st section of the second article of the arkansas constitution that declared that the free white men of this state shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons buzzard had carried a concealed weapon and stood indicted by virtue of the authority of the th section of an act of the legislature prohibiting any person wearing a pistol dirk large knife or swordcane concealed as a weapon unless upon a journey under the penalties of fine and imprisonment justice lacy in a dissenting opinion in buzzard summarizing the majority viewpoint to which he disagreed declared that the words a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state and the words common defense clearly show the true intent and meaning of these constitutions ie ark and us and prove that it is a political and not an individual right and of course that the state in her legislative capacity has the right to regulate and control it this being the case then the people neither individually nor collectively have the right to keep and bear arms joel prentiss bishops influential commentaries on the law of statutory crimes took buzzards militiabased interpretation a view that bishop characterized as the arkansas doctrine as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in american law political scientist earl kruschke has categorized both bliss and buzzard as being cases illustrating the individual view professor eugene volokh revealed in the california political review that a statement in a concurring opinion in buzzard was the only support for a collective right view of the right to keep and bear arms in the th century in the kansas supreme court in salina v blaksley made the first collective right judicial interpretation the kansas high court declared that the provision in question applies only to the right to bear arms as a member of the state militia or some other military organization provided for by law is also apparent from the second amendment to the federal constitution which says a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the united states commonly exist these three models are founded on differing interpretations of the second amendment a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the first model the individualrights model holds that a right of individuals is to own and possess firearms much as the first amendment protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech this view was confirmed by the supreme court in district of columbia v heller than had previous interpretations by the court prior to the supreme courts ruling in heller there was a split among the federal courts with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view and one federal circuit court having not addressed the question the second two models focus on the preamble or purpose clause of the amendment the words a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the second model the collective model holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to individuals under the belief that the rights only purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia the third model the modified collective model holds that the right to keep and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia and then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed supreme court justice antonin scalia in wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations nadine strossen former president of the american civil liberties union has stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable regulation strossen said it is no more absolute than freedom of speech or any other right in the constitution no right is absolute the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy constitutional strict scrutiny and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance in october the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit stated there are numerous instances of the phrase bear arms being used to describe a civilians carrying of arms early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the people or citizen or citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves or himself and the state or equivalent words thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage bear arms was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service in united states v miller us the supreme court rejected a second amendment challenge to the national firearms act prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered title ii weapons jack miller and frank layton did unlawfullytransport in interstate commerce fromclaremoreoklahoma tosiloam springsarkansas a certain firearma double barrelshotgun having a barrel less than inches in lengthat the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commercenot having registered said firearm as required by section d of title united states code and not having in their possession a stampaffixed written orderas provided by section c in a unanimous opinion authored by justice mcreynolds the supreme court stated the objection that the act usurps police power reserved to the states is plainly untenable as the court explained in the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia we cannot say that the second amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense gun rights advocates claim that the court in miller ruled that the second amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of ordinary military equipment they also claim that the court did not consider the question of whether the sawedoff shotgun in the case would be an applicable weapon for personal defense instead looking solely at the weapons suitability for the common defense law professor andrew mcclurg states the only certainty about miller is that it failed to give either side a clearcut victory most modern scholars recognize this fact according to the syllabus prepared by the us supreme court reporter of decisions in district of columbia v heller us the supreme court held that the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as selfdefense within the home pp other legal summaries of the courts findings in this case are similar on june the court in mcdonald v chicago us held that the second amendment was fully incorporated within the th amendment this means that the court ruled that the second amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government it also remanded a case regarding a chicago handgun prohibition four of the five justices in the majority voted to do so by way of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment while the fifth justice clarence thomas voted to do so through the amendments privileges or immunities clause interest groups primarily in the united states exert political pressure for and against legislation limiting the right to keep and bear arms this political debate in america is organized between those who seek stricter regulations and those who believe gun regulations violate the second amendment protection of a right to keep and bear arms the largest advocacy group in this regard is the national rifle association and its political wing the nra institute for legislative action the nra has been described as one of the largest and most powerful political special interest groups in the united states several other groups including the gun owners of america and the citizens committee for the right to keep and bear arms while smaller in size are also politically active the main gun control advocacy group is the brady campaign which has been described as considerably less effective than gunrights organizations 
noninterventionism the diplomatic policy whereby a nation seeks to avoid alliances with other nations in order to avoid being drawn into wars not related to direct territorial selfdefense has had a long history of popularity in the government and among the people of the united states at various periods in time robert walpole britains first whig prime minister proclaimed in my politics are to keep free from all engagements as long as we possibly can he emphasized economic advantage and rejected the idea of intervening in european affairs to maintain a balance of power walpoles position was known to americans however during the american revolution the second continental congress debated about forming an alliance with france it rejected noninterventionism when it was apparent that the american revolutionary war could be won in no other manner than a military alliance with france which benjamin franklin successfully negotiated in  when britain and france went to war in george washington declared neutrality with unanimous support of his cabinet after deciding that the treaty with france of did not apply washingtons farewell address of explicitly announced the policy of american noninterventionism president thomas jefferson extended washingtons ideas about foreign policy in his march inaugural address jefferson said that one of the essential principles of our government is that of peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none in president james monroe articulated what would come to be known as the monroe doctrine which some have interpreted as noninterventionist in intent in the wars of the european powers in matters relating to themselves we have never taken part nor does it comport with our policy so to do it is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent injuries or make preparations for our defense after tsar alexander ii put down the january uprising in poland french emperor napoleon iii asked the united states to join in a protest to the tsar secretary of state william h seward declined defending our policy of noninterventionstraight absolute and peculiar as it may seem to other nations and insisted that the american people must be content to recommend the cause of human progress by the wisdom with which they should exercise the powers of selfgovernment forbearing at all times and in every way from foreign alliances intervention and interference the united states policy of nonintervention was maintained throughout most of the th century the first significant foreign intervention by the us was the spanishamerican war which ultimately resulted in the philippineamerican war from  theodore roosevelts administration is credited with inciting the panamanian revolt against colombia in order to secure construction rights for the panama canal begun in  the president of the united states woodrow wilson after winning reelection with the slogan he kept us out of war was able to navigate neutrality in the great war for about three years early on the presence in the us of immigrants with divided loyalties in the conflict helped maintain neutrality various causes compelled american entry into world war i the american congress to declare war on germany and so involve the nation on the side of the triple entente in world war i a few months after the declaration of war wilson gave a speech to congress outlining his aims to end the conflict labeled the fourteen points while this american proclamation was less triumphalist than the aims of some of its allies it did propose in the final point that a general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike after the war wilson traveled to europe and stayed for months to labor on the postwar treaty no president had previously enjoined such sojourn outside of the country in that treaty of versailles wilsons association was formulated as the league of nations in the wake of the first world war the noninterventionist tendencies of us foreign policy gained ascendancy the treaty of versailles and thus united states participation in the league of nations even with reservations was rejected by the republicandominated senate in the final months of wilsons presidency a group of senators known as the irreconcilables identifying with both william borah and henry cabot lodge had great objections regarding the clauses of the treaty which compelled america to come to the defense of other nations lodge echoing wilson issued reservations regarding the treaty among them the second argued that america would sign only with the understanding that nothing compels the united states to ensure border contiguity or political independence of any nation to interfere in foreign domestic disputes regardless of their status in the league or to command troops or ships without congressional declaration of warcitation needed while some of the sentiment was grounded in adherence to constitutional principles some of the sentiment bore a reassertion of nativist and inwardlooking policy although the united states was unwilling to commit to the league of nations they continued to engage in international negotiations and treaties in august fifteen nations signed the kelloggbriand pact brainchild of american secretary of state frank kellogg and french foreign minister aristide briand this pact that was said to have outlawed war and showed the united states commitment to international peace had its semantic flaws for example it did not hold the united states to the conditions of any existing treaties it still allowed european nations the right to selfdefense and it stated that if one nation broke the pact it would be up to the other signatories to enforce it the kelloggbriand pact was more of a sign of good intentions on the part of the us rather than a legitimate step towards the sustenance of world peace the economic depression that ensued after the crash of also continued to abet nonintervention the attention of the country focused mostly on addressing the problems of the national economy the rise of aggressive expansionism policies by fascist italy and the empire of japan led to conflicts such as the italian conquest of ethiopia and the japanese invasion of manchuria these events led to ineffectual condemnations by the league of nations official american response was muted america also did not take sides in the brutal spanish civil war as europe moved closer to war in the late s the united states congress continued to demand american neutrality between and much to the dismay of president roosevelt congress passed the neutrality acts for example in the final neutrality act americans could not sail on ships flying the flag of a belligerent nation or trade arms with warring nations such activities had played a role in american entrance into world war i on september germany invaded poland britain and france subsequently declared war on germany marking the start of world war ii in an address to the american people two days later president roosevelt assured the nation that he would do all he could to keep them out of war however his words showed his true goals when peace has been broken anywhere the peace of all countries everywhere is in danger roosevelt said even though he was intent on neutrality as the official policy of the united states he still echoed the dangers of staying out of this war he also cautioned the american people to not let their wish to avoid war at all costs supersede the security of the nation the war in europe split the american people into two camps noninterventionists and interventionists the two sides argued over americas involvement in this second world war the basic principle of the interventionist argument was fear of german invasion by the summer of france suffered a stunning defeat by germans and britain was the only democratic enemy of germany in a speech roosevelt argued some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we can safely permit the united states to become a lone island in a world dominated by the philosophy of force a national survey found that in the summer of of americans believed that a germanitalian victory would endanger the united states that if such an event occurred supported arming to the teeth at any expense to be prepared for any trouble and that favored the immediate adoption of compulsory military training for all young men ultimately the ideological rift between the ideals of the united states and the goals of the fascist powers empowered the interventionist argument writer archibald macleish asked how could we sit back as spectators of a war against ourselves in an address to the american people on december president roosevelt said the axis not merely admits but proclaims that there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and our philosophy of government however there were still many who held on to noninterventionism although a minority they were well organized and had a powerful presence in congress progerman or antibritish opinion contributed to noninterventionism roosevelts national share of the presidential vote declined by seven percentage points from of the counties in which his share declined by points or more were largely germanspeaking of the counties in which his share declined by to points german was the largest or secondlargest original nationality in noninterventionists rooted a significant portion of their arguments in historical precedent citing events such as washingtons farewell address and the failure of world war i if we have strong defenses and understand and believe in what we are defending we need fear nobody in this world robert maynard hutchins president of the university of chicago wrote in a essay isolationists believed that the safety of the nation was more important than any foreign war as became the actions of the roosevelt administration made it more and more clear that the united states was on a course to war this policy shift driven by the president came in two phases the first came in with the passage of the fourth neutrality act which permitted the united states to trade arms with belligerent nations as long as these nations came to america to retrieve the arms and pay for them in cash this policy was quickly dubbed cash and carry the second phase was the lendlease act of early this act allowed the president to lend lease sell or barter arms ammunition food or any defense article or any defense information to the government of any country whose defense the president deems vital to the defense of the united states american public opinion supported roosevelts actions as united states involvement in the battle of the atlantic grew with incidents such as the sinking of the ussreuben jamesdd by late of americans agreed that the biggest job facing this country today is to help defeat the nazi government and thought that defeating germany was more important than staying out of the war isolationist families sons fought in the war as much as others during the presidency of barack obama some members of the united states federal government including president obama and secretary of state john kerry considered intervening militarily in the syrian civil war a poll from late april found that of americans thought that the united states has no responsibility to do something about the fighting in syria between government forces and antigovernment groups with only twentyfive percent disagreeing with that statement a writer for the new york times referred to this as an isolationist streak a characterization international relations scholar stephen walt strongly objected to calling the description sloppy journalism according to walt the overwhelming majority of people who have doubts about the wisdom of deeper involvement in syriaincluding yours trulyare not isolationist they are merely sensible people who recognize that we may not have vital interests there that deeper involvement may not lead to a better outcome and could make things worse and who believe that the last thing the united states needs to do is to get dragged into yet another nasty sectarian fight in the arabislamic world in december the pew research center reported that their newest poll americans place in the world had revealed that percent of respondents in the national poll said that the united states should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own this was the most people to answer that question this way in the history of the question one which pollsters began asking in only about a third of respondents felt this way a decade ago a july poll of battleground voters across the united states found percent in favor of full withdrawal from afghanistan by the end of only percent and percent interested in more involvement in syria and ukraine respectively and percent agreeing with the statement that us military actions should be limited to direct threats to our national security rathbun compares three separate themes in conservative policies since the s conservatism neoconservatism and isolationism these approaches are similar in that they all invoked the mantle of realism and pursued foreign policy goals designed to promote national interests conservatives however were the only group that was realist in the academic sense in that they defined the national interest narrowly strove for balances of power internationally viewed international relations as amoral and especially valued sovereignty by contrast neoconservatives based their foreign policy on nationalism and isolationists sought to minimize any involvement in foreign affairs and

in the united states of america samesex marriage has been legal nationwide since june when the united states supreme court ruled in obergefell v hodges that statelevel bans on samesex marriage are unconstitutional the court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to samesex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the due process and the equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution the ruling overturned a precedent baker v nelson while civil rights campaigning took place from the s the issue became prominent from around when the hawaii supreme court ruled in baehr v lewin that the prohibition was unconstitutional the ruling led to federal actions and actions by several states to restrict marriage to malefemale couples in particular the defense of marriage act doma during the period of to various lower court decisions state legislation and popular referendums had already legalized samesex marriage to some degree in thirtyeight out of fifty us states in the us territory guam and in the district of columbia in the supreme court overturned a key provision of doma declaring part of it unconstitutional and in breach of the fifth amendment in united states v windsor because it singled out a class of persons for discrimination by refusing to treat their marriages equally under federal law when state law had created them equally valid the ruling led to the federal governments recognition of samesex marriage with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized however the ruling focused on the provision of doma responsible for the federal government refusing to acknowledge state sanctioned samesex marriages leaving the question of state marriage laws itself to the individual states the supreme court addressed that question two years later in ruling in obergefell that samesex married couples were to be constitutionally accorded the same recognition as oppositesex couples at stateterritory levels as well as at federal level by the time that samesex marriage became legal nationally public opinion on the subject had reached almost approval levels according to polls by the wall street journal the human rights campaign and cnn having been consistently over since and trending consistently upward over the years prior the movement to obtain civil marriage rights and benefits for samesex couples in the united states began in the s in the case baker v nelson the minnesota supreme court ruled that denying marriage licenses to samesex couples did not violate the us constitution on appeal the united states supreme court denied to hear the case establishing it as a federal precedent as it came from mandatory appellate review the issue did not become prominent in us politics until the hawaii supreme court decision in baehr v lewin that declared that states prohibition to be unconstitutional during the st century while several countries elsewhere in the world were opening marriage for samesex couples public support in the us for samesex marriage has grown considerably and national polls conducted since show that a majority of americans support legalizing it however at the same time many statesspecify also passed bans against samesex marriage either legislatively or by referendum on may massachusetts became the first us state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize samesex marriage following the supreme judicial courts decision in goodridge v department of public health six months earlier on may barack obama became the first sitting us president to publicly declare support for the legalization of samesex marriage on november maine maryland and washington became the first states to legalize samesex marriage through popular vote in june the supreme court ruled in united states v windsor that federal law could not treat as unequal marriages that individual states had created as equally valid when it overturned a key provision of the defense of marriage act doma thus forcing federal recognition of samesex marriage and marriagerelated benefits when related to a samesex marriage performed by a state that sanctioned such marriages in the two years following windsor us district courts in statesa and state courts in six statesb plus one state court ruling addressing only the recognition of samesex marriages from other jurisdictionsc found that samesex marriage bans violate the us constitution while two us district courtsd and one state courte found that they did not the flow of federal appeal cases rejecting samesex marriage bans was finally interrupted in november in contrast to all other circuits that had ruled at the time the sixth circuit ruled such bans to be constitutional the panel ruling reversed six us district court rulings that had found bans on samesex marriage or its recognition to be unconstitutional reinstating state bans in the four states served by that circuit kentucky michigan ohio and tennesseef on january the us supreme court agreed to hear four cases on appeal from the sixth circuit on whether states may constitutionally ban samesex marriages or refuse to recognize such marriages legally performed in another state the cases were obergefell v hodges ohio tanco v haslam tennessee deboer v snyder michigan and bourke v beshear kentucky decided by the court under the heading of obergefell on june a majority of justices led by justice anthony kennedy reversed the sixth circuits upholding of state bans and declared that the courts rulings must evolve in the light of better understanding of discrimination and the constitutional protections available to protect minorities and that samesex couples have the constitutional rights to marry and to have their marriages recognized obergefell therefore overturned the courts own prior ruling in baker prior to obergefell samesex marriage was legal to at least some degree in thirtyeight states one territory guam and the district of columbia of the states missouri kansas and alabama had restrictions until united states v windsor it was only legal in states and washington dc beginning in july over forty federal and state courts cited windsor to strike down state bans on the licensing andor recognition of samesex marriage missouri recognized samesex marriages from out of state and samesex marriages licensed by the city of st louis under two separate state court orders two other jurisdictions issued such licenses as well in kansas marriage licenses were available to samesex couples in most counties but the state did not recognize their validity some counties in alabama issued marriage licenses to samesex couples for three weeks until the state supreme court ordered probate judges to stop doing so that courts ruling did not address the recognition of samesex marriages already licensed in alabama but referred to them as purported marriage licenses in two additional states samesex marriages were previously legal between the time their bans were struck down and then stayed michigan recognized the validity of more than marriage licenses issued to samesex couples and those marriages arkansas recognized the more than marriage licenses issued to samesex couples there and the federal government had not taken a position on arkansass marriage licenses the legal issues surrounding samesex marriage in the united states are determined by the nations federal system of government in which the status of a person including marital status is determined in large measure by the individual states prior to the federal government did not define marriage any marriage recognized by a state was recognized by the federal government even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more states as was the case until with interracial marriage which some states banned by statute prior to samesex marriage was not performed in any us jurisdiction it was subsequently legalized in different jurisdictions through legislation court rulings tribal council rulings and popular vote in referenda the supreme courts ruling in obergefell renders moot any remaining legal challenges as it specifically orders states to both issue marriage licenses to samesex couples and to recognize as valid marriages performed in other states according to the federal governments government accountability office gao in more than rights and protections are conferred to us citizens upon marriage by the federal government areas affected include social security benefits veterans benefits health insurance medicaid hospital visitation estate taxes retirement savings pensions family leave and immigration law since july married samesex couples throughout the united states have equal access to all the federal benefits that married oppositesex couples have the defense of marriage act doma was enacted in domas section says that no state need recognize the legal validity of a samesex relationship even if recognized as marriage by another state it purports to relieve a state of its reciprocal obligation to honor the laws of other states as required by the constitutions full faith and credit clause even before doma however states sometimes refused to recognize a marriage from another jurisdiction if it was counter to its strongly held public policies most lawsuits that seek to require a state to recognize a marriage established in another jurisdiction argue on the basis of equal protection and due process not the full faith and credit clauseg domas section defined marriage for the purposes of federal law as a union of one man and one woman it was challenged in the federal courts on july judge joseph tauro of the district court of massachusetts held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married massachusetts samesex couples is unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the us constitution beginning in eight federal courts found doma section unconstitutional in cases involving bankruptcy public employee benefits estate taxes and immigration on october the second circuit court of appeals became the first court to hold sexual orientation to be a quasisuspect classification and applied intermediate scrutiny to strike down section of doma as unconstitutional in windsor v united states the us supreme court ruled in windsor on june that section violated the fifth amendmenth as a result of the windsor decision married samesex couplesregardless of domicilehave federal tax benefits including the ability to file joint federal income tax returns military benefits federal employment benefits and immigration benefits in february the justice department expanded federal recognition of samesex marriages to include bankruptcies prison visits survivor benefits and refusing to testify against a spouse likewise in june family medical leave benefits under the family medical leave act were extended to married samesex couples with respect to social security and veterans benefits samesex married couples are eligible for full benefits from the veterans affairs va and the social security administration ssa prior to the supreme courts ruling in obergefell v hodges on june the va and ssa could provide only limited benefits to married samesex couples living in states where samesex marriage was not legal effective march the definition of spouse under the family and medical leave act of includes employees in a samesex marriage regardless of state of residence following the obergefell decision the justice department extended all federal marriage benefits to married samesex couples nationwide the federal government recognizes the marriages of samesex couples who married in certain states in which samesex marriage was legal for brief periods between the time a court order allowed such couples to marry and that court order was stayed including michigan the federal government also recognized marriages performed in utah from december to january even while the state didnt under similar circumstances the federal government never took a position on indiana or wisconsins marriages performed in brief periods though it did recognize them once the respective states announced they would do so it had not taken a position with respect to similar marriages in arkansas prior to the obergefell decision legalising and recognising samesex marriages in all states opponents of samesex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing samesex unions by attempting to amend the united states constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman in the federal marriage amendment which would prohibit states from recognizing samesex marriages was approved by the senate judiciary committee on a partyline vote and was debated by the full senate but was ultimately defeated in both houses of congress on april the alabama state house adopted a resolution calling for a constitutional convention to propose an amendment to ban samesex marriage nationwide samesex marriages are licensed in and recognized by all us states and washington dc as well as all us territories except american samoa on july the attorney general for american samoa stated we are reviewing the opinion obergefell v hodges and its potential applicability to american samoa and will provide comment when it is completed on january alabamas chief justice roy moore issued a ruling forbidding state officials from issuing marriage licenses to samesex couples the ruling had no effect and all alabama counties continued either issuing marriage licenses to all couples or not issue licenses at all and in may moore was charged with ethics charges by the state judicial inquiry commission for the ruling officials of fourteen counties in three states are still unwilling to issue licenses to samesex couples those wishing to marry within the state must travel to another part of the state in order to obtain a license postobergefell six states have on occasion attempted to deny samesex couples full adoption rights to varying degrees in arkansas florida indiana and wisconsin samesex couples have been met with rejection when trying to get both parents names listed on the birth certificate alabamas highest court attempted to void an adoption decree obtained by a samesex couple in georgia but the supreme court reversed restoring joint custody to the adoptive mother on march mississippi previously banned samesex couples from adopting but this law was ruled unconstitutional by the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi on march the ruling was described as having the effect of making samesex adoption essentially legal in all states the supreme court decision legalizing samesex marriage in the states and territories did not legalize samesex marriage on indian lands in the united states congress not the federal courts has legal authority over indian country thus unless congress passes a law regarding samesex marriage on indian tribes federally recognized american indian tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws as of the time of the obergefell ruling tribal jurisdictions legally recognize samesex marriage some tribes have passed legislation specifically addressing samesex relationships and some specify that state law and jurisdiction govern tribal marriages note this table shows only states that licensed and recognized samesex marriages or had legalized them before obergefell v hodges it does not include states that recognized samesex marriages from other jurisdictions but did not license them samesex marriage supporters make several arguments in support of their position gail mathabane likens prohibitions on samesex marriage to past us prohibitions on interracial marriage fernando espuelas argues that samesex marriage should be allowed because samesex marriage extends a civil right to a minority group according to an american history scholar nancy cott there really is no comparison because there is nothing that is like marriage except marriage the human rights campaign hrc is one of the leading advocacy groups in support of samesex marriage according to the hrcs website many samesex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in lovemany in fact have spent the last or years with that personand they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad through all the joys and challenges family life brings in the united states such professional organizations as the american psychiatric association american psychological association american sociological association american anthropological association american medical association american academy of pediatrics american academy of nursing and national association of social workers have said that claims that the legal recognition of marriage for samesex couples undermines the institution of marriage and harms children are inconsistent with the scientific evidence supporting the conclusions that homosexuality is a normal expression of human sexuality that is not chosen that gay and lesbian people form stable committed relationships essentially equivalent to heterosexual relationships that samesex parents are no less capable than oppositesex parents to raise children that no civilization or viable social order depends on an institution of exclusive heterosexual marriage and that the children of samesex parents are no less psychologically healthy and welladjusted than children of oppositesex parents the body of research strongly supports the conclusion that discrimination by the federal government between married samesex couples and married oppositesex couples in granting benefits unfairly stigmatizes samesex couples the research also contradicts the stereotypebased rationales advanced to support passage of doma that the equal protection clause was designed to prohibit the democratic party platform used the term marriage equality in its expression of support supporters of the legalization of samesex marriage have successfully used social media websites such as facebook to help achieve that goal some have argued that the successful use of social media websites by lgbt groups has played a key role in the defeat of religionbased opposition one of the largest scale uses of social media to mobilize support for samesex marriage preceded and coincided with the arrival at the us supreme court of highprofile legal cases for proposition and the defense of marriage act in march the red equals sign project started by the human rights campaign was an electronic campaign primarily based on facebook that encouraged users to change their profile images to a red equal sign to express support for samesex marriage at the time of the court hearings it was estimated that approximately million facebook users changed their profile images to a red equals sign opponents of samesex marriage in the united states ground their arguments on parenting concerns religious concerns concerns that changes to the definition of marriage would lead to the inclusion of polygamy or incest natural lawbased reasoning and tradition the southern baptist convention adopted a statement in june that legalizing samesex relationships would convey a societal approval of a homosexual lifestyle which the bible calls sinful and dangerous both to the individuals involved and to society at large the church of jesus christ of latterday saints the united states conference of catholic bishops the southern baptist convention and national organization for marriage claim that children do best when raised by a mother and father and that legalizing samesex marriage is therefore contrary to the best interests of children maggie gallagher of the national organization for marriage has raised concerns about the impact of samesex marriage upon religious liberty and upon faithbased charities in the united states opponents of samesex marriage have claimed that redefining marriage to include samesex relationships would have harmful effects on biological family childrens rights and social welfare stanley kurtz of the weekly standard has written that samesex marriage would eventually lead to the legalization of polygamy and polyamory or group marriage in the united states the funding of the amendment referendum campaigns has been an issue of great dispute both judges and the irs have ruled that it is either questionable or illegal for campaign contributions to be shielded by anonymity in february the national organization for marriage vowed to spend in washington legislative races to defeat the republican state senators who voted for samesex marriage president obamas views on samesex marriage have varied over the course of his political career and become more consistently supportive of samesex marriage rights over time in the s he had supported samesex marriage while campaigning for the illinois senate during the presidential campaign he said i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman for me as a christian it is a sacred union you know god is in the mix he opposed the california referendum that aimed at reversing a court ruling establishing samesex marriage there in he opposed two opposing federal legislative proposals that would have banned or established samesex marriage nationally stating that each state had to decide the issue in december he expressed support for civil unions with rights equivalent to marriage and for federal recognition of samesex relationships he opposed a federal constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage he also stated that his position on samesex marriage was evolving and that he recognized that civil unions from the perspective of samesex couples was not enough on may president obama became the first sitting president to say he believed that samesex couples should be allowed to marry he still said the legal question belonged to the states in october obama told an interviewer that his view had changed ultimately i think the equal protection clause does guarantee samesex marriage in all fifty states but as you know courts have always been strategic there have been times where the stars were aligned and the court like a thunderbolt issues a ruling like brown v board of education but thats pretty rare and given the direction of society for the court to have allowed the process to play out the way it has may make the shift less controversial and more lasting former presidents bill clinton and jimmy carter former vice presidents dick cheney al gore walter mondale and current vice president joe biden have voiced their support for legal recognition as have former first ladies laura bush and hillary clinton former president george h w bush and his wife barbara have served as witnesses to a samesex wedding but neither has publicly stated whether this means they support samesex marriage in general george w bush reportedly offered to officiate the same wedding but has similarly not made a public statement regarding his position on the issue as president he was opposed fifteen us senators announced their support in the spring of by april a majority of the senate had expressed support for samesex marriage senator rob portman of ohio became the first sitting republican senator to endorse samesex marriage in march followed by senator mark kirk of illinois in april lisa murkowski of alaska in june and susan collins of maine a year later during the presidential election campaign republican vicepresidential candidate sarah palin stated i have voted along with the vast majority of alaskans who had the opportunity to vote to amend our constitution defining marriage as between one man and one woman i wish on a federal level that thats where we would go because i dont support gay marriage when a us district court invalidated the california referendum that ended samesex marriages there in former speaker of the house newt gingrich said it showed an outrageous disrespect for our constitution and for the majority of people of the united states who believe marriage is the union of husband and wife by the end of gingrich was prepared to accept civilbut not religioussamesex marriages and encouraged the republican party to accept the fact of samesex marriage was certain to become legal in more and more states in an interview on the oreilly factor in august when glenn beck was asked if he believes that gay marriage is a threat to this country in any way he stated no i dont i believe that thomas jefferson said if it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket what difference is it to me on his radio show in august commentator rush limbaugh said marriage theres a definition of it for it it means something marriage is a union of a man and woman its always been that if you want to get married and youre a man marry a woman nobodys stopping you this is about tearing apart an institution a cnn poll on february found that of americans believe gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry up from in august in the wake of the obergefell decision cnn polling found that of americans felt the decision was correct a washington postabc news poll from februarymarch found a record high of of americans approve of samesex marriage with only opposed and with no opinion in may a gallup poll showed that of americans would vote for a law legalizing samesex marriage in all states three previous readings over the course of a year consistently showed support at or above gallup noted just three years ago support for gay marriage was the current level of support is essentially double the in gallups initial measurement on gay marriage in some commentators however have noted instances where polling data has understated voter opposition to referendums banning samesex marriage one study concluded that polls on gay marriage ballot initiatives generally underestimate the opposition to gay marriage by about seven percentage points as of update public support for samesex marriage in the united states has solidified above public support for samesex marriage has grown at an increasing pace since the s in just of americans supported legalization of samesex marriage polls have shown that support is identical among whites and hispanics while support for samesex marriage trails among blacks polling trends in and showed support for samesex marriage gaining a majority although the difference is within the error limit of the analysis on may gallup reported majority support for samesex marriage for the first time in the country in june two prominent polling organizations released an analysis of the changing trend in public opinion about samesex marriage in the united states concluding that public support for the freedom to marry has increased at an accelerating rate with most polls showing that a majority of americans now support full marriage rights for all americans until the supreme courts june ruling in united states v windsor required the federal government to treat legally married samesex couples on an equal basis with heterosexual married couples samesex married couples faced severe disadvantages the federal government did not recognize those marriages for any purpose according to a general accounting office study at least us federal laws and regulations include references to marital status a study by the congressional budget office found statutory provisions in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits rights and privileges many of these laws govern property rights benefits and taxation samesex couples whose marriages are not recognized by the federal government are ineligible for spousal and survivor social security benefits and are ineligible for the benefits due the spouse of a federal government employee one study found that the difference in social security income for samesex couples compared to oppositesex married couples was per year compared to similarly situated oppositesex married couples samesex couples faced the following financial and legal disadvantages some companies were offering spousal benefits to samesex couples as of update in states that recognized samesex marriages samesex couples could continue to receive those same benefits only if they married only of private employers offered domestic partner health care benefits samesex couples face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as oppositesex married couples including the marriage penalty in taxation while social service providers usually do not count one partners assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner a legally married couples joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance the congressional budget office study working from an assumption that about percent of adults would enter into samesex marriages if they had the opportunity an assumption in which they admitted significant uncertainty estimated that legalizing samesex marriage throughout the united states would improve the budgets bottom line to a small extent by less than billion in each of the next years this result reflects an increase in net government revenues increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for social security and federal employee health benefits but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for medicaid medicare and supplemental security income based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting samesex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation these organizations include the american psychoanalytic association and the american psychological association several psychological studies have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations and media messages about samesex marriage creates a harmful environment for the lgbt population that may affect their health and wellbeing one study surveyed more than lesbian gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the states that have outlawed samesex marriage had the highest reports of minority stressthe chronic social stress that results from minoritygroup stigmatizationas well as general psychological distress according to the study the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress past research has shown that minority stress is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse two other studies examined personal reports from lgbt adults and their families living in memphis tennessee immediately after a successful ballot campaign banned samesex marriage most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities the studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress says jennifer arm a counseling graduate student at the university of memphis at the perry v schwarzenegger trial expert witness ilan meyer testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as proposition did not exist because when people are exposed to more stressthey are more likely to get sick and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people you are not welcome here your relationships are not valued such laws have significant power he said in a pair of economists at emory university tied the passage of state bans on samesex marriage in the us to an increase in the rates of hiv infection the study linked the passage of samesex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual hiv rate within that state of roughly cases per population a study by the columbia mailman school of public health found that gay men in massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of samesex marriage in that state united states case law

the united states environmental protection agency epa or sometimes usepa is an agency of the us federal government which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by congress the epa was proposed by president richard nixon and began operation on december after nixon signed an executive order the order establishing the epa was ratified by committee hearings in the house and senate the agency is led by its administrator who is appointed by the president and approved by congress the current administrator is gina mccarthy the epa is not a cabinet department but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank the epa has its headquarters in washington dc regional offices for each of the agencys ten regions and laboratories the agency conducts environmental assessment research and education it has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws in consultation with state tribal and local governments it delegates some permitting monitoring and enforcement responsibility to us states and the federally recognized tribes epa enforcement powers include fines sanctions and other measures the agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts the agency has approximately fulltime employees and engages many more people on a contractual basis more than half of epa human resources are engineers scientists and environmental protection specialists other groups include legal public affairs financial and information technologists beginning in the late s and through the s congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment a key legislative option to address this concern was the declaration of a national environmental policy advocates of this approach argued that without a specific policy federal agencies were neither able nor inclined to consider the environmental impacts of their actions in fulfilling the agencys missioncitation needed the statute that ultimately addressed this issue was the national environmental policy act of nepa usc senator henry m jackson proposed and helped write s the bill that eventually became the national environmental policy act the law was signed by president nixon on january nepa was the first of several major environmental laws passed in the s it declared a national policy to protect the environment and created a council on environmental quality ceq in the executive office of the presidentcitation needed to implement the national policy nepa required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment the detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement eis in president richard nixon proposed an executive reorganization that would consolidate many of the federal governments environmental responsibilities under one agency a new environmental protection agency that reorganization proposal was reviewed and passed by the house and senate for at least years before nepa was enactedbettersourceneeded congress debated issues that the act would ultimately addresscitation needed the act was modeled on the resources and conservation act of introduced by senator james e murray in the th congress that bill would have established an environmental advisory counsel in the office of the president declared a national environmental policy and required the preparation of an annual environmental reportbettersourceneeded in the years following the introduction of senator murrays bill similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congresss potential responses to perceived problems in a joint housesenate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs senator henry m jackson and the house committee on science and astronautics representative george miller to discuss the need for and potential means of implementing a national environmental policy in the colloquium some members of congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment the epa began regulating greenhouse gases ghgs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the clean air act caa for the first time on january standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to section of the caa and ghgs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of part c of title i of the act see the page regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act for further information in may congress renamed the epa headquarters as the william jefferson clinton federal building after former president bill clinton each epa regional office is responsible within its states for implementing the agencys programs except those programs that have been specifically delegated to states each regional office also implements programs on indian tribal lands except those programs delegated to tribal authorities the legislation here is general environmental protection legislation and may also apply to other units of the government including the department of the interior and the department of agriculture in the epa launched the energy star program a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency epa administers the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act fifra which is much older than the agency and registers all pesticides legally sold in the united states epa is responsible for reviewing environmental impact statements of other federal agencies projects under the national environmental policy act nepa through the safer detergents stewardship initiative sdsi epas design for the environment dfe recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to nonpolluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water nonylphenol ethoxylates commonly referred to as npes are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant the design for the environment which was renamed to epa safer choice in has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates these safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available cleangredients is a source of safer surfactants the epa safer choice label previously known as the design for the environment dfe label helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients without sacrificing quality or performance when a product has the safer choice label it means that every intentionally added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by epa scientists only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the safer choice label manufacturers selling automobiles in the united states are required to provide epa fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources the fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicles clean air act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests the current testing system was originally developed in and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rushhour in los angeles during that era prior to the epa reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test in the epa began adjusting city aka urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds results downward by and highway aka highway fuel economy test or hwfet results by to compensate for changes in driving conditions since and to better correlate the epa test results with realworld driving in the epa proposed updating the federal testing procedures to add a new higher speed test us and an airconditioner on test sc to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with realworld reports the updated testing methodology was finalized in december for implementation with model year vehicles and set the precedent of a year review cycle for the test procedures in february the organization launched a program called your mpg that allows drivers to add realworld fuel economy statistics into a database on the epas fuel economy website and compare them with others and the original epa test results it is important to note that the epa actually conducts these tests on very few vehicles while the public mistakenly presumes that this federal agency is hard at work conducting complicated tests on every new model of truck van car and suv in reality just of the epas employees work in the automobiletesting department in ann arbor michigan examining to vehicles a year or roughly percent of new models as to that other percent the epa takes automakers at their wordwithout any testingaccepting submitted results as accurate twothirds of the vehicles the epa tests themselves are selected randomly and the remaining third are tested for specific reasons although originally created as a reference point for fossil fuelled vehicles driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will do on a single charge the air quality modeling group aqmg is in the epas office of air and radiation oar and provides leadership and direction on the full range of air quality models air pollution dispersion models and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing pollution control strategies and the impacts of air pollution sources the aqmg serves as the focal point on air pollution modeling techniques for other epa headquarters staff epa regional offices and state and local environmental agencies it coordinates with the epas office of research and development ord on

draft of revised epa regulations relaxes the regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water stating that current standards are impractical to enforce the epa is recommending that intervention is not necessary until drinking water is contaminated with radioactive iodine at a concentration of picocuries per liter the limit for short term exposure set by the international atomic energy agency which is times the current epa limit of picocuries per liter for long term exposure epa has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation on march the united states navy transferred usns bold a stalwart class ocean surveillance ship to the epa now known as osv bold the ship previously used in antisubmarine operations during the cold war is equipped with sidescan sonar underwater video water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline one of the major missions of the bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials are dumped from dredging operations in us ports in the bold was awarded to seattle central community college sccc by the general services administration sccc demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose and acquired the ship at a cost of  advance identification or adid is a planning process used by the epa to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material the epa conducts the process in cooperation with the us army corps of engineers and local states or native american tribes as of february adid projects had been completed and were ongoing in the latest center for effective government analysis of federal agencies which receive the most freedom of information act foia requests published in using and data the most recent years available the epa earned a d by scoring out of a possible points ie did not earn a satisfactory overall grade there has been political controversywho over whether environmental regulations generally increase or decrease national employment in the epa issued the long term enhanced surface water treatment rule lt the rule requires covering openair reservoirs containing finished drinking water in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water to comply with the rule the epa ordered that a cap be placed over the hillview reservoir the open reservoir where water bound for new york citys receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines that serve the city a number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary the hillview project is currently being reviewed by the epa in portland oregon there was opposition to capping its reservoirs from a local citizens group and city officials but recently the city has decided to stop fighting and bring its reservoirs into compliance with lt epa director anne m gorsuch resigned under fire in during a scandal over mismanagement of a billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps gorsuch based her administration of the epa on the new federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states she believed that the epa was overregulating business and that the agency was too large and not costeffective during her months as agency head she cut the budget of the epa by reduced the number of cases filed against polluters relaxed clean air act regulations and facilitated the spraying of restricteduse pesticides she cut the total number of agency employees and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency in congress charged that the epa had mishandled the billion toxic waste superfund and demanded records from gorsuch gorsuch refused and became the first agency director in us history to be cited for contempt of congress the epa turned the documents over to congress several months later after the white house abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by congress because they were covered by executive privilege at that point gorsuch resigned her post citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation critics charged that the epa was in a shambles at that time in july an epa report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuelefficient cars was delayed the report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it but at the last minute the epa delayed its release the state of california sued the epa for its refusal to allow california and other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars epa administrator stephen l johnson claimed that the epa was working on its own standards but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level which would then preempt state laws california governor arnold schwarzenegger along with governors from other states stated that the epas actions ignored federal law and that existing california standards adopted by many states in addition to california were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards it was reported that stephen johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision after the federal government bailed out general motors and chrysler in the automotive industry crisis of the chevrolet equinox was released with epa fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors independent road tests found that the vehicle did not outperform its competitors which had much lower fuel economy ratings later road tests found better but inconclusive results palmbased biodiesel and renewable diesel failed to meet the minimum greenhouse gas ghg emissions savings threshold requirement to qualify as renewable fuels under the us renewable fuel standard palm oil plantations threaten the habitats of the endangered orangutan and dwarf elephant in december epa administrator stephen l johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfarea decision that would trigger the first national mandatory globalwarming regulations associate deputy administrator jason burnett emailed the draft to the white house white house aideswho had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate changeknew the gist of what johnsons finding would be burnett said they also knew that once they opened the attachment it would become a public record making it controversial and difficult to rescind so they did not open it rather they called johnson and asked him to take back the draft us law clearly stated that the final decision was the epa administrators not president bushs johnson rescinded the draft in july he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare burnett resigned in protest in the agency began a strategic planning exercise to develop plans for a more virtual approach to library services the effort was curtailed in july when the agency proposed a million cut in its budget for libraries based on the proposed budget the epa posted a notice to the federal register september that epa headquarters library would close its doors to walkin patrons and visitors on october the epa also closed some of its regional libraries and reduced hours in others using the same fy proposed budget numbers on october the agency reopened regional libraries in chicago dallas and kansas city and the library at its headquarters in washington dc in june the epa library network published a strategic plan for fiscal years  in march nine states california new york new jersey new hampshire massachusetts maine connecticut new mexico and vermont sued the epa the epas inspector general had determined that the epas regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the clean air act and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees the epa had suppressed a study it commissioned by harvard university which contradicted its position on mercury controls the suit alleges that the epas rule allowing exemption from maximum available control technology was illegal and additionally charged that the epas system of pollution credit trading allows power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations illinoiss proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of by  an august report released by epas inspector general claimed that the white house put pressure on the epa to delete cautionary information about the air quality in new york city around ground zero following the september attacks tiny particles under micrometres are attributed to health and mortality concerns so some health advocates want the epa to regulate it the science may be in its infancy although many conferences have discussed the trails of this airborne matter in the air foreign governments such as australia and most member state of the european union have addressed this issue the epa first established standards in and strengthened them in as with other standards regulation and enforcement of the pm standards is the responsibility of the state governments through state implementation plans in april the union of concerned scientists said that more than half of the nearly epa staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work the survey included chemists toxicologists engineers geologists and experts in other fields of science about of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years the highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life epa research has also been suppressed by career managers supervisors at epas national center for environmental assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peerreviewed journal article about epas integrated risk information system which led two coauthors to have their names removed from the publication and the corresponding author chinghung hsu to leave epa because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing epa subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint even if those papers are written on personal time a million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by epa management during both the bush and obama administrations and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps epa employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports in the government accountability office stated that the epa violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms the social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the waters of the united states rule including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule the epa has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice administrator christine todd whitman was criticized for her changes to president bill clintons executive order during removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation and therefore defeating the spirit of the executive order in a march report the inspector general of the agency concluded that the epa has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan and has not established values goals expectations and performance measurements for environmental justice in its daily operations another report in september found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs policies and activities towards environmental justice studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the epas superfund program and that this situation was worsening many issues of environmental justice are localized and are therefore hard to be addressed by federal agencies such as the epa without significant media attention political interest or crisis status local issues are less likely to be addressed at the local or federal level with a still developing sector of environmental justice under the epa small local incidents are unlikely to be solved compared to larger well publicized incidents the white house maintains direct control over the epa and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power republicans and democrats differ in their approaches to and perceived concerns of environmental justice while president bill clinton signed the executive order the bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices which in turn affected the motivation for environmental enforcement the epa is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes informing the public of environmental enforcement and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution water pollution hazardous wastes and chemicals while the epa aids in preventing and identifying hazardous situations it is hard to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities it is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to the epa answers to various groups competes for resources and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment all of these present challenges including a lack of resources its selfpolicing policy and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for epa officers under different circumstances the epa faces many limitations to enforcing environmental justice it does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities on august while examining the level of pollutants in the gold king mine epa workers released over three million gallons of toxic waste water including heavy metals such as lead and arsenic into cement creek which flowed into the animas river in colorado 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca commonly called the affordable care act aca or colloquially obamacare is a united states federal statute signed into law by president barack obama on march together with the health care and education reconciliation act amendment it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the us healthcare system since the passage of medicare and medicaid in under the act hospitals and primary physicians would transform their practices financially technologically and clinically to drive better health outcomes lower costs and improve their methods of distribution and accessibility the aca was enacted to increase the quality and affordability of health insurance lower the uninsured rate by expanding public and private insurance coverage and reduce the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government it introduced mechanisms like mandates subsidies and insurance exchanges the law requires insurance companies to cover all applicants within new minimum standards and offer the same rates regardless of preexisting conditions or sex in the congressional budget office projected that the aca would lower both future deficits and medicare spending on june the united states supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the acas individual mandate as an exercise of congresss taxing power in the case national federation of independent business v sebelius however the court held that states cannot be forced to participate in the acas medicaid expansion under penalty of losing their current medicaid funding since the ruling the law and its implementation have continued to face challenges in congress and federal courts and from some state governments conservative advocacy groups labor unions and small business organizations on june in the case king v burwell the supreme court affirmed that the laws federal subsidies to help individuals pay for health insurance are available in all states not just in those that have set up state exchanges in march the centers for disease control and prevention reported that the average number of uninsured during the period from january to september was million fewer than the average in in april gallup reported that the percentage of adults who were uninsured dropped from in the third quarter of to in the first quarter of  the affordable care act aca or obamacare includes numerous provisions that took effect between and policies issued before are exempted by a grandfather clause from many of the changes to insurance standards but they were affected by other provisions significant reforms most of which took effect on january include a note in the fpl was for a single person and for family of four see subsidy calculator for specific dollar amount b dhhs and cbo estimate the average annual premium cost in would have been for a family of without the reform the patient protection and affordable care act consists of a combination of measures to control healthcare costs and an expansion of coverage through public and private insurance broader medicaid eligibility and medicare coverage and subsidized regulated private insurance an individual mandate coupled with subsidies for private insurance as a means for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals the concept goes back to at least when the conservative heritage foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to singlepayer health care it was championed for a time by conservative economists and republican senators as a marketbased approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems specifically because the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala requires any hospital participating in medicare which nearly all do to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay when president bill clinton proposed a healthcare reform bill in that included a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations republican senators proposed an alternative that would have required individuals but not employers to buy insurance ultimately the clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex after failing to obtain a comprehensive reform of the healthcare system clinton negotiated a compromise with the th congress to instead enact the state childrens health insurance program schip in  the republican alternative introduced by senator john chafee as the health equity and access reform today act contained a universal coverage requirement with a penalty for noncompliancean individual mandateas well as subsidies to be used in statebased purchasing groups advocates for the bill included prominent republicans who by the time of the affordable care act opposed a mandate such as senators orrin hatch chuck grassley bob bennett and kit bond of the republicans senators from supported the heart act another republican proposal introduced in by senator don nickles rok the consumer choice health security act contained an individual mandate with a penalty provision however nickles subsequently removed the mandate from the bill stating he had decided that government should not compel people to buy health insurance at the time of these proposals republicans did not raise constitutional issues with the mandate mark pauly who helped develop a proposal that included an individual mandate for george h w bush remarked i dont remember that being raised at all the way it was viewed by the congressional budget office in was effectively as a tax in an insurance expansion bill was enacted at the state level in massachusetts the bill contained both an individual health insurance mandate and an insurance exchange republican governor mitt romney vetoed the mandate but after democrats overrode his veto he signed it into law romneys implementation of the health connector exchange and individual mandate in massachusetts was at first lauded by republicans during romneys presidential campaign senator jim demint praised romneys ability to take some good conservative ideas like private health insurance and apply them to the need to have everyone insured romney said of the individual mandate im proud of what weve done if massachusetts succeeds in implementing it then that will be the model for the nation in a year after the massachusetts reform republican senator bob bennett and democratic senator ron wyden introduced the healthy americans act which also featured an individual mandate and statebased regulated insurance markets called state health help agencies the bill initially attracted bipartisan support but died in committee many of the sponsors and cosponsors remained in congress during the healthcare debate by many democrats were considering using this approach as the basis for healthcare reform experts have said that the legislation that eventually emerged from congress in and bears many similarities to the bill and that it was deliberately patterned after romneys state healthcare plan jonathan gruber a professor of economics at mit and an architect of massachusetts health care reform who advised the clinton and obama presidential campaigns on healthcare issues served as a technical consultant to the obama administration and helped draft the aca healthcare reform was a major topic of discussion during the democratic presidential primaries as the race narrowed attention focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates hillary clinton and the eventual nominee barack obama each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately million americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year clintons plan would have required all americans to obtain coverage in effect an individual mandate while obamas provided a subsidy but rejected the use of an individual mandate during the general election obama said that fixing healthcare would be one of his top four priorities if he won the presidency after his inauguration obama announced to a joint session of congress in february his intent to work with congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform by july a series of bills were approved by committees within the house of representatives on the senate side from june to september the senate finance committee held a series of meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill this group in particular democrats max baucus jeff bingaman and kent conrad and republicans mike enzi chuck grassley and olympia snowe met for more than hours and the principles that they discussed in conjunction with the other committees became the foundation of the senates healthcare reform bill with universal healthcare as one of the stated goals of the obama administration congressional democrats and health policy experts like jonathan gruber and david cutler argued that guaranteed issue would require both community rating and an individual mandate to ensure that adverse selection andor free riding would not result in an insurance death spiral they convinced obama that this was necessary and persuaded him to accept congressional proposals that included a mandate this approach was taken because the president and congressional leaders had concluded that more progressive plans such as the singlepayer medicare for all act could not obtain filibusterproof support in the senate by deliberately drawing on bipartisan ideas the same basic outline was supported by former senate majority leaders howard baker bob dole tom daschle and george j mitchellthe bills drafters hoped to increase the chances of garnering the necessary votes for passage however following the adoption of an individual mandate as a central component of the proposed reforms by democrats republicans began to oppose the mandate and threatened to filibuster any bills that contained it senate minority leader mitch mcconnell who led the republican congressional strategy in responding to the bill calculated that republicans should not support the bill and worked to keep party discipline and prevent defections it was absolutely critical that everybody be together because if the proponents of the bill were able to say it was bipartisan it tended to convey to the public that this is ok they must have figured it out republican senators including those who had supported previous bills with a similar mandate began to describe the mandate as unconstitutional journalist ezra klein wrote in the new yorker that the end result was a policy that once enjoyed broad support within the republican party suddenly faced unified opposition reporter michael cooper of the new york times wrote that it can be difficult to remember now given the ferocity with which many republicans assail it as an attack on freedom but the provision in president obamas healthcare law requiring all americans to buy health insurance has its roots in conservative thinking the reform negotiations also attracted a great deal of attention from lobbyists including deals between certain lobby groups and the advocates of the law to win the support of groups that had opposed past reforms as in the sunlight foundation documented many of the reported ties between the healthcare lobbyist complex and politicians in both major parties during the august summer congressional recess many members went back to their districts and entertained town hall meetings to solicit public opinion on the proposals over the recess the tea party movement organized protests and many conservative groups and individuals targeted congressional town hall meetings to voice their opposition to the proposed reform bills there were also many threats made against members of congress over the course of the congressional debate to maintain the progress of the legislative process when congress returned from recess in september president obama delivered a speech to a joint session of congress supporting the ongoing congressional negotiations to reemphasize his commitment to reform and again outline his proposals he acknowledged the polarization of the debate and quoted a letter from the late senator edward ted kennedy urging on reform what we face is above all a moral issue that at stake are not just the details of policy but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country on november the house of representatives passed the affordable health care for america act on a vote and forwarded it to the senate for passage the senate began work on its own proposals while the house was still working on the affordable health care for america act instead the senate took up hr a bill regarding housing tax breaks for service members as the united states constitution requires all revenuerelated bills to originate in the house the senate took up this bill since it was first passed by the house as a revenuerelated modification to the internal revenue code the bill was then used as the senates vehicle for their healthcare reform proposal completely revising the content of the bill the bill as amended would ultimately incorporate elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the senate health and finance committees with the republican minority in the senate vowing to filibuster any bill they did not support requiring a cloture vote to end debate votes would be necessary to get passage in the senate at the start of the th congress democrats had only votes the senate seat in minnesota ultimately won by al franken was still undergoing a recount and arlen specter was still a republican to reach votes negotiations were undertaken to satisfy the demands of moderate democrats and to try to bring several republican senators aboard particular attention was given to bob bennett mike enzi chuck grassley and olympia snowe negotiations continued even after july when franken was sworn into office and by which time specter had switched parties due to disagreements over the substance of the bill which was still being drafted in committee and because moderate democrats hoped to win bipartisan support then on august before the bill could come up for a vote ted kennedya longtime healthcare reform advocatedied depriving democrats of their th vote before kennedys seat was filled attention was drawn to snowe because of her vote in favor of the draft bill in the finance committee on october but she explicitly stated that this did not mean she would support the final bill paul kirk was appointed as senator kennedys temporary replacement on september  after the finance committee vote negotiations turned to the demands of moderate democrats whose votes would be necessary to break the anticipated republican filibuster majority leader harry reid focused on satisfying the democratic caucuss centrist members until the holdouts came down to joe lieberman of connecticut an independent who caucused with democrats and ben nelson a conservative democrat representing nebraska lieberman despite intense negotiations with reid in search of a compromise refused to support a public option agreeing to vote for the bill only if the provision were not included although it had majority support in congress his demand was met there was debate among the bills supporters over the importance of the public option although the vast majority of supporters concluded it was a minor part of the reform overall and congressional democrats fight for it won various concessions including conditional waivers allowing states to set up statebased public options such as vermonts green mountain care with every other democrat now in favor and every republican now opposed the white house and reid moved on to addressing nelsons concerns in order to win filibusterproof support for the bill they had by this point concluded it was a waste of time dealing with snowe because after her vote for the draft bill in the finance committee she had come under intense pressure from the republican senate leadership after a final hour negotiation nelsons support for the bill was won with two concessions a compromise on abortion modifying the language of the bill to give states the right to prohibit coverage of abortion within their own insurance exchanges which would require consumers to pay for the procedure out of pocket if the state so decided and an amendment to offer a higher rate of medicaid reimbursement for nebraska the latter half of the compromise was derisively called the cornhusker kickback and was repealed in the subsequent reconciliation amendment bill on december the senate voted to end debate on the bill a cloture vote to end the filibuster the bill then passed also on december with all democrats and two independents voting for it and all republicans against except jim bunning who did not vote the bill was endorsed by the ama and aarp several weeks later on january massachusetts republican scott brown was elected to the senate in a special election to replace the late ted kennedy having campaigned on giving the republican minority the st vote needed to sustain republican filibusters the special election had become significant to the reform debate because of its effects on the legislative process the first was psychological the symbolic importance of losing kennedys traditionally democratic massachusetts seat made many congressional democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill the second effect was more practical the loss of the democratic supermajority complicated reform proponents legislative strategy browns election meant democrats could no longer break a filibuster in the senate in response white house chief of staff rahm emanuel argued that democrats should scale back to a less ambitious bill house speaker nancy pelosi pushed back dismissing emanuels scaleddown approach as kiddie care obama also remained insistent on comprehensive reform and the news that anthem blue cross in california intended to raise premium rates for its patients by as much as gave him a new line of argument to reassure nervous democrats after scott browns win on february president obama laid out a senateleaning proposal to consolidate the bills he held a meeting with both parties leaders on february with democrats having lost a filibusterproof supermajority in the senate but having already passed the senate bill with votes on december comprehensive reform proponents most workable option was for the house to abandon its bill the affordable health care for america act and pass the senates bill the patient protection and affordable care act instead various health policy experts encouraged the house to pass the senate version but house democrats were not happy with it and had expected to be able to negotiate changes in a housesenate conference before passing a final bill with that option off the table since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the senate bill would have to be passed in the senate despite another republican filibuster most house democrats agreed to pass the senate bill on condition that it be amended by a subsequent bill they drafted the health care and education reconciliation act which could be passed by the reconciliation process unlike rules under regular order as per the congressional budget act of reconciliation cannot be subject to a filibuster but reconciliation is limited to budget changes which is why the procedure was not used to pass the aca in the first place the bill had inherently nonbudgetary regulations still although the already passed senate bill could not have been passed by reconciliation most of house democrats demands were budgetary these changeshigher subsidy levels different kinds of taxes to pay for them nixing the nebraska medicaid dealmainly involve taxes and spending in other words theyre exactly the kinds of policies that are wellsuited for reconciliation the remaining obstacle was a pivotal group of prolife democrats led by bart stupak who were initially reluctant to support the bill the group found the possibility of federal funding for abortion significant enough to warrant opposition the senate bill had not included language that satisfied their abortion concerns but they could not include additional such language in the reconciliation bill as it would be nonbudgetary and thus outside the processs domain instead obama issued executive order reaffirming the principles in the hyde amendment this won the support of stupak and members of his group and assured the bills passage the house passed the senate bill with a vote on march with democrats and all republicans voting against it the next day republicans introduced legislation to repeal the bill obama signed the aca into law on march the amendment bill the health care and education reconciliation act was also passed by the house on march the senate passed it by reconciliation on march and obama signed it on march  the affordable care act represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the us healthcare system since the passage of medicare and medicaid in the new york times summarized the overall impact of the affordable care act on a variety of dimensions during october the number of uninsured persons has been reduced significantly about million people remain enrolled in private coverage through the online marketplaces of those qualified for federal subsidies to help pay premiums for those who qualified for subsidies through the federal exchange the subsidies lowered the cost by on average middleincome persons who dont qualify for subsidies are more likely to have challenges with premium costs it is too early to tell whether the act has affected health outcomes while healthcare costs have grown slower in recent years the effect of aca on this trend is unclear the healthcare industry has generally been helped by the law due to the additional customers the law created for it the aca has two primary mechanisms for increasing insurance coverage expanding medicaid eligibility to include individuals within of the federal poverty level and creating statebased insurance exchanges where individuals and small business can buy health insurance plansthose individuals with incomes between and of the federal poverty level will be eligible for subsidies to do so the congressional budget office cbo originally estimated that the legislation will reduce the number of uninsured residents by million leaving million uninsured residents in after the bills provisions have all taken effect with the elderly covered by medicare the cbo estimate projected that the law would raise the proportion of insured nonelderly citizens from to a july cbo estimate raised the expected number of uninsured by million reflecting the successful legal challenge to the acas expansion of medicaid among the people who will remain uninsured aca drafters believed that increasing insurance coverage would not only improve quality of life but also help reduce medical bankruptcies currently the leading cause of bankruptcy in america and job lock in addition many believed that expanding coverage would help ensure that the cost controls successfully function healthcare providers could more easily adapt to payment system reforms that incentivize value over quantity if their costs were partially offsetfor example hospitals having to do less charity care or insurers having larger and more stable risk pools to distribute costs over due to the new regulations of guaranteed issue and allowing children to be included on their parents plans until age several insurance companies announced that they would stop issuing new childonly policies however because children would now be covered by their parents plans the census bureau found that the number of uninsured to yearolds had declined by or people by starting january state health insurance exchanges will be required to offer a childonly coverage option and medicaid eligibility will be made available to million individuals with incomes below of the federal poverty level under the law those workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies in the exchanges to be eligible per the laws definition the cost of employerbased health insurance must exceed of the workers household income in january the internal revenue service ruled that only the cost of covering the individual employee would be considered in determining whether the cost of coverage exceeded of income however the cost of a family plan is often higher but the ruling means that those higher costs will not be considered even if the extra premiums push the cost of coverage above the income threshold the new york times said this could leave million americans unable to afford family coverage under their employers plans and ineligible for subsidies to buy coverage elsewhere multiple and studies and surveys indicated that the number of uninsured had fallen due to expanded medicaid eligibility and health insurance exchanges established due to ppaca these changes took effect january  the act establishes statebased health insurance exchanges the exchanges are regulated online marketplaces administered by either federal or state government where individuals and small business can purchase private insurance plans starting october with coverage beginning january individuals with incomes between and of the federal poverty level who purchase insurance plans via an exchange will be eligible to receive federal subsidies to help pay premium costs the exchanges will take the form of websites where the private plans allowed on sale within them will be regulated and comparable consumers will be able to visit these websites or ring a call center compare the plans on offer fill out a form to the government that will be used to determine their eligibility for subsidies and then purchase the insurance of their choice from the options available during limited open enrollment periods the first open enrollment period will last from october to march after which time uninsured individuals generally may not purchase insurance through an exchange until the following open enrollment period in subsequent years the open enrollment period will start on october and end on december despite some controversy members of congress and their staff will participate in this system they are required to obtain health insurance through the exchanges or plans otherwise approved by the bill such as medicare instead of the federal employees health benefits program that they currently use the insurance exchanges are a method designed to create a market for private insurance in a way that addresses market failures such as the high number of uninsured medical bankruptcies coverage limits unaffordability and inflation through regulation only approved plans that meet certain standards will be allowed to be sold on the exchanges and insurers will be prohibited from denying insurance to consumers on the basis of preexisting conditions several methods will be employed to make these plans affordable subsidies will be provided to those eligible regulations intended to reduce prices through competition will make plans and prices more transparent and price comparisons more accessible for consumers with online information and federally approved multistate plans will be phasedinto state exchanges to help guarantee enough options and price regulations will be implemented including a minimum medical loss ratio and partial community rating that prevents price discrimination from pricing individuals out of the market through unaffordable plans or premium increases on the insurednamely poor and sick individuals who are more expensive to cover for insurers motivated either by profit maximization andor the economics of insurance specifically the risk of an insurance pool not providing enough netpremiums to offset netpayouts these regulations are enabled to function due to the individual mandate the requirement to buy insurance or pay a penaltyand the limits on open enrollment without which healthy people might putoff insuring themselves until they got sick in such a situation insurers would have to raise their premiums to afford the remaining relatively sicker and thus more expensive population which could create a vicious cycle in which more and more people drop their coverage a result known as an insurance death spiral alternatively the process could settle at a stable equilibrium relying on relatively high premiums for the insured and less coverage and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy for the uninsured the absence of the mandate would have likely caused the exchanges as a whole to malfunction and ultimately perform similarly to the current private insurance market according to its supporters based on studies by the cbo jonathan gruber and rand health have concluded conversely the inclusion of the mandate increases the size and diversity of the insured population broadening the risk pool to spread the cost of insurance in a sustainable manner policy experience in new jersey on the one hand and massachusetts on the other offers evidence of such divergent outcomes in september the congressional budget office estimated that nearly six million will pay the penalty in  under the law setting up an exchange gives a state partial discretion on standards and prices of insurance aside from those specifics setout in the aca for example those administering the exchange will be able to determine which plans are sold on or excluded from the exchanges and adjust through limits on and negotiations with private insurers the prices on offer they will also be able to impose higher or statespecific coverage requirementsincluding whether plans offered in the state are prohibited from covering abortion making the procedure an outofpocket expense or mandated to cover abortions that a physician determines is medically necessary in either case federal subsidies are prohibited from being used to fund the procedure if a state does not set up an exchange itself they lose that discretion and the responsibility to set up exchanges for such states defaults to the federal government whereby the department of health and human services assumes the authority and legal obligation to operate all functions in these federally facilitated exchanges as of may states and the district of columbia plan to operate statebased exchanges themselves seven of which will do so in partnership with the federal governmentan arrangement where they retain discretionary management but the federal government executes various functions the remaining states default to federally facilitated exchanges the law is also designed to be flexible by allowing states from onwards to apply for a waiver for state innovation from the federal government that allows them to experiment with their own statebased system on condition that it meets certain criteria to obtain a waiver a state must pass legislation setting up an alternative health system that provides insurance at least as comprehensive and as affordable as that the aca would covers at least as many residents and does not increase the federal deficit provided a state meets these conditions receiving a waiver can exempt states from some of the central requirements of the aca including the individual mandate the provision of an insurance exchange and the employer mandate the state would also receive compensation equal to the aggregate amount of any federal subsidies and tax credits for which its residents and employers would have been eligible under the aca plan if they cannot be paid out due to the structure of the state plan in may vermont a state in which republicans are but a small minority had enacted green mountain care a statebased singlepayer system for which they intended to pursue a waiver to implement in december vermont decided not to pursue the singlepayer system early implementation efforts for the healthcare exchanges especially the exchanges operated by the federal government have received nearly universally negative reactions in the media and from politicians healthcaregov the website that allows people to apply for insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government crashed on opening and suffered from a rash of problems throughout the first month many users have also found the available plans to be unattractive ongoing problems with the website have prompted the development of healthsherpa an independently produced alternative to healthcaregov that contains consumer information various committees in both chambers of congress have conducted hearings where cyber security concerns related to healthcaregov have been discussed experts disagree over the extent healthcaregov is vulnerable to cyber attacks as of march radio ads providing information on the affordable care act have been broadcast in ojibwe yupik inupiat lakota and navajo according to indian country today media network the house energy and commerce committee reported on april that of individuals and families who had selected a health plan in the federally facilitated marketplace had paid their first months premium and that of paid enrollees are ages to on the same day committee ranking member henry a waxman issued a statement saying the reporting was inaccurate irresponsible and outofdate accompanied by a memorandum detailing the basis behind his statement a week later representatives for top health insurance companies told members of congress that more than percent of people whove signed up under the new health care law have gone on to pay their premiums on july the government accountability office released a nonpartisan study that concluded the administration did not provide effective planning or oversight practices in developing the healthcaregov website the aca includes regulations that set standards for insurance some specified in the law others subsequently established by the secretary of health and human services among these new standards are a ban on the ability to drop policyholders if they become sick a ban on price discrimination on the basis of preexisting conditions or sex through a partial community rating and allowing children and dependents to remain on their parents insurance plan until their th birthday under the laws authorization secretary of health kathleen sebelius issued a set of defined essential health benefits that all new insurance plans have to include insurers are prohibited from imposing annual or lifetime coverage caps on these essential benefits these cover ambulatory patient services emergency services hospitalization maternity and newborn care mental health and substance use disorder services including behavioral health treatment prescription drugs rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices laboratory services preventive and wellness services and chronic disease management and pediatric services including oral and vision care in determining what would qualify as an essential benefit the law requires that the scope of standard benefits should equal that of a typical employer plan states have some discretion in determining what should be considered the benchmark plan within the requirements of the law and may include services beyond those set out by the secretary among the essential health benefits preventive care childhood immunizations and adult vaccinations and medical screenings are covered by an insurance plans premiums and cannot be subject to any copayments coinsurance or deductibles specific examples of such services covered include mammograms and colonoscopies wellness visits gestational diabetes screening hpv testing sti counseling hiv screening and counseling fdaapproved contraceptive methods breastfeeding support and supplies and domestic violence screening and counseling in addition the law established four tiers of coverage bronze plan silver plan gold plan and platinum plan all categories offer the same set of essential health benefits what the categories specify is the division of premiums and outofpocket costs bronze plans will have the lowest monthly premiums and highest outofpocket costs and vice versa for platinum plans the percentages of health care costs that plans are expected to cover through premiums as opposed to outofpocket costs are on average bronze silver gold and platinum insurers are also required to implement an appeals process for coverage determination and claims on all new plans they are also required to spend at least of premium dollars on health costs and claims instead of administrative costs and profits rebates must be issued to policyholders if this is violated one provision in the law mandates that health insurance cover additional preventive care and screenings for women as specified in regulations to be issued by the health resources and services administration hrsa the hrsa guidelines issued august included in this mandate all food and drug administration approved contraceptive methods sterilization procedures and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity this mandate applies to all employers and educational institutions except for religious organizations these regulations were included on the recommendations of the institute of medicine which concluded that access to contraception is medically necessary to ensure womens health and wellbeing the initial regulations proved controversial among certain religious groups most notably evangelicals and lutherans and especially the roman catholic hierarchy whose hospitals charities and educational institutions of higher learning as well as other enterprises oppose contraception on doctrinal grounds to accommodate those concerns while still guaranteeing access to contraception the regulations were adjusted to allow religious organizations to opt out of the requirement to include birth control coverage in their employee insurance plans in those instances the insurers themselves will offer contraception coverage to enrollees directly at no additional cost the contraception rule has also been challenged by corporations as a burden against their religious expression the first challenge to reach the supreme court was burwell v hobby lobby the court ruled that closely held corporations such as hobby lobby would be exempt from the contraception rule under the religious freedom restoration act which applies to regulations that govern the activities of closely held forprofit corporations in a follow up case to burwell v hobby lobby the us supreme court issued an injunction pending appeal under which an evangelical college in illinois and other religiously affiliated nonprofit groups will not have to fill out a form offered to religious nonprofits that would effectively transfer the cost of its employees contraceptives to insurers wheaton college argued that filling out the form would trigger emergency contraceptive coverage and is therefore still against the institutions religious beliefs several studies on insurance premiums expect that with the subsidies offered under the aca more people will pay less than they did prior to the reforms than those who will pay more and that those premiums will be more stable even in changing health circumstances and transparent due to the regulations on insurance the kaiser family foundation has calculated that about half the people who currently buy insurance on their own today will be eligible for subsidies among those receiving subsidies which excludes those with incomes above four times the poverty line about for individuals or for a family of four the subsidies are projected to be worth an average of per household which would effectively discount the projected price of insurance by twothirds on average for individuals npr and the kaiser family foundation collaborated to produce a quick online calculator for people to estimate their premiums and subsidy amount based on where they live income and family size for the effect on health insurance premiums the cbo forecast that by the individual market would comprise of the market and that premiums per person would increase by to but that over half of these individuals would receive subsidies that would decrease the premium paid to well below premiums charged under current law it also forecast that for the small group market of the market premiums would be impacted to and to for those receiving subsidies for the large group market comprising of the market premiums would be impacted to with those under high premium plans subject to excise taxes being charged to less factors taken into account by this analysis included increased benefits particularly for the individual market more healthy policyholders due to the mandate administrative efficiencies related to the health exchanges and highpremium insurance plans reducing some benefits in response to the tax as of september the final projections of the average monthly premium scheduled to be offered in the exchanges came in below cbo expectations reducing expected costs not only for consumers but also for the government by reducing the overall cost of the subsidies larry levitt a health policy analyst from the kaiser family foundation noted that the individual market compromises a relatively small share of those under and said in contrast i dont think anyone expects significant cost increases in the employer market where the majority of americans get their health insurance secretary of health and human services kathleen sebelius also indicated that some cost increase in the individual market was expected because the standard of insurance allowed in the insurance exchanges would be higher quality than that generally available currently and thus more expensive and that the government subsidies provided to make insurance affordable are intended to more than offset this effect in june a study by the kaiser family foundation focused on actual experience under the act as it affected individual market consumers those buying insurance on their own the study found that the medical loss ratio provision of the act had saved this group of consumers billion in and billion in reducing their costs by the bulk of the savings were in reduced premiums for individual insurance but some came from premium rebates paid to consumers by insurance companies that had failed to meet the requirements of the act the associated press reported that as a result of acas provisions closing the medicare part d coverage gap between the initial coverage limit and the catastrophic coverage threshold in the prescription drug program individuals formerly falling in this donut hole would save about percent almost all clarification needed of the savings came reportedly because with regard to brandname drugs aca secured a discount from pharmaceutical companies the change benefited more than two million people most of them in the middle class in a may presentation on health costs and the federal budget the cbo stated that rising health costs will put tremendous pressure on the federal budget during the next few decades and beyond in cbos judgment the health legislation enacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish that pressure the cbo further observed that putting the federal budget on a sustainable path would almost certainly require a significant reduction in the growth of federal health spending relative to current law including this years health legislation and concluded  there is considerable agreement that a substantial share of current spending on health care contributes little if anything to peoples health and providers and health analysts are making significant efforts to make the health system more efficient though it is not clear what specific policies the federal government can adopt to generate fundamental changes in the health system that is it is not clear what specific policies would translate the potential for significant cost savings into reality jonathan cohn a health policy analyst commented cbo doesnt produce estimates of how reform will affect overall health care spending that is the amount of money our society as a whole will devote to health care but the official actuary for medicare does the actuary determined that the longterm trend is towards less spending inflation after ten years would be lower than it is now and its the longterm trend that matters most the affordable care act will reduce the cost of carenot by a lot and not by as much as possible in theory but as much as is possible in this political universe he and fellow the new republic editor noam scheiber claimed the cbo did not include in its estimate various costsaving provisions intended to reduce health inflation also positing that the cbo has a history of consistently underestimating the impact of health legislation jonathan gruber a consultant who helped develop both the massachusetts healthcare reform under mitt romney and the aca has acknowledged that the aca is not guaranteed to significantly bend the curve of rising healthcare costs the real question is how far the aca will go in slowing cost growth here there is great uncertaintymostly because there is such uncertainty in general about how to control cost growth in health care there is no shortage of good ideas for ways of doing so there is however a shortage of evidence regarding which approaches will actually workand therefore no consensus on which path is best to follow in the face of such uncertainty the aca pursued the path of considering a range of different approaches to controlling health care costs whether these policies by themselves can fully solve the long run health care cost problem in the united states is doubtful they may however provide a first step towards controlling costsand understanding what does and does not work to do so more broadly the law created the center for medicare and medicaid innovation and requires numerous pilot programs and demonstrations that may affect healthcare costs these cost reductions were not factored into cbo cost estimates the business roundtable an association of ceos commissioned a report from the consulting company hewitt associates which found that the legislation could potentially reduce that trend line by more than per employee to with respect to insurance premiums it also stated that the legislation could potentially reduce the rate of future health care cost increases by to when fully phased in by the group cautioned that all of this would be dependent upon the success of the costsaving government pilot programs which must then be wholly copied in the private market the centers for medicare and medicaid services reported in that while costs per capita continue to rise the rate of increase in annual healthcare costs has fallen since per capita cost increases have averaged annually since costs relative to gdp which had been rising have stagnated since several studies have attempted to explain the reduction in the rate of annual increase reasons include among others uncertainty exists about the extent to which each factor is responsible for the recent reduction in health inflation and about the durability of the overall trend including the accompanying reduction in longterm deficit projections due to reduced healthcare costs however several studies found that the temporary effects of the recession cannot account for the entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit one study estimated that the changes to the health system are responsible for about a quarter of the recent reduction in inflation paul krawzak posits that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the longterm burden placed by demographic changes particularly the growth of the population on medicare the comprehensive cbo estimate projected a net deficit reduction of more than billion during the period it calculated the law would result in billion in total outlays offset by billion in total receipts resulting in a billion net reduction in the deficit the cbo separately noted that while most of the spending provisions do not begin until revenue will still exceed spending in those subsequent years the cbo averred that the bill would substantially reduce the growth of medicares payment rates for most services impose an excise tax on insurance plans with relatively high premiums and make various other changes to the federal tax code medicare medicaid and other programsultimately extending the solvency of the medicare trust fund by years however this estimate was made prior to the supreme courts ruling that enabled states to opt out of the medicaid expansion thereby forgoing the federal funding the cbo and jct subsequently updated the budget projection estimating the impact of the ruling would reduce the cost estimate of the insurance coverage provisions by billion the cbo reported in june that repeal of the aca would increase the deficit between billion and billion over the period in total depending on the impact of macroeconomic feedback effects in other words aca is a deficit reducer as its repeal would raise the deficit cbo also reported that repeal of aca would likely raise economic output mainly by boosting the supply of labor as lowincome persons would have more incentive to work without healthcare coverage provided by aca major sources of deficit reduction include higher medicare taxes on the wealthy new annual fees on health insurance providers similar fees on the healthcare industry such as manufacturers and importers of brandname pharmaceutical drugs and certain medical devices limits on tax deductions of medical expenses and flexible spending accounts a new excise tax on cadillac insurance policies plans with annual insurance premiums in excess of for an individual or for a family revenue from mandate penalty payments a federal sales tax on indoor tanning services and spending offsets such as a reduction in medicare reimbursements to insurers and drug companies for private medicare advantage policies that the government accountability office and medicare payment advisory commission found to be overpaid relative to government medicare and reductions in medicare reimbursements to hospitals that do not meet standards of efficiency and care although the cbo generally does not provide cost estimates beyond the year budget projection period because of the degree of uncertainty involved in the projection it decided to do so in this case at the request of lawmakers and estimated a second decade deficit reduction of trillion cbo predicted deficit reduction around a broad range of onehalf percent of gdp over the s while cautioning that a wide range of changes could occur a commonly heard complaint regarding the cbo cost estimates is that cbo was required to exclude from its initial estimates the effects of likely doc fix legislation that would increase medicare payments by more than billion from to however the doc fix is a separate issue that would have existed whether or not the aca became law omitting its cost from the aca is no different from omitting the cost of the bush tax cuts there was mixed opinion about the cbo estimates uwe reinhardt a health economist at princeton wrote that the rigid artificial rules under which the congressional budget office must score proposed legislation unfortunately cannot produce the best unbiased forecasts of the likely fiscal impact of any legislation but went on to say but even if the budget office errs significantly in its conclusion that the bill would actually help reduce the future federal deficit i doubt that the financing of this bill will be anywhere near as fiscally irresponsible as was the financing of the medicare modernization act of douglas holtzeakin cbo director during the george w bush administration who later served as the chief economic policy adviser to us senator john mccains presidential campaign alleged that the bill would increase the deficit by billion because he argued it frontloaded revenue and backloaded benefits the new republic editors noam scheiber and jonathan cohn countered critical assessments of the laws deficit impact arguing that it is as likely if not more so for predictions to have underestimated deficit reduction than to have overestimated it they noted that it is easier for example to account for the cost of definite levels of subsidies to specified numbers of people than account for savings from preventive healthcare and that the cbo has a track record of consistently overestimating the costs of and underestimating the savings of health legislation innovations in the delivery of medical care like greater use of electronic medical records and financial incentives for more coordination of care among doctors would produce substantial savings while also slowing the relentless climb of medical expenses but the cbo would not consider such savings in its calculations because the innovations hadnt really been tried on such large scale or in concert with one anotherand that meant there wasnt much hard data to prove the savings would materialize david walker former us comptroller general now working for the peter g peterson foundation has stated that the cbo estimates are not likely to be accurate because they are based on the assumption that congress is going to do everything they say theyre going to do the center on budget and policy priorities objected in its analysis congress has a good record of implementing medicare savings according to their study congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past years to produce medicare savings the employer mandate is a penalty that will be incurred by employers with more than employees that do not offer health insurance to their fulltime workers this provision was included as a disincentive for employers considering dropping their current insurance plans once the insurance exchanges began operating as an alternative source of insurance proponents of the reform law wanted to address the parts of the healthcare system they believed to not be working well while causing minimal disruption to those happy with the coverage they have lawmakers recognized that approximately of americans already have insurance of whom of the total population are covered directly or indirectly through an employer and of the total population are covered by the governmentmainly though medicare and medicaid while of the total population reported themselves satisfied with their insurance situation significant minorities even among those that reported favorably had medicallyrelated financial troubles andor dissatisfaction with aspects of their insurance coverage especially among the poor and sick the intent of the employer mandate along with a grandfather clause in the aca is to help ensure that existing employersponsored insurance plans that people like will stay in place as no company with fewer than fulltime employees will face this penalty manywho are concerned that the employer mandate creates a perverse incentive for business to employ people parttime instead of fulltime this hypothetical phenomenon has sometimes been referred to by commentators on both sides of the political spectrum as the obamacare effect despite concerns over a massive spike in parttime workers driven by costcutting efforts on the part of large employers the number of parttime jobs in the united states had in fact declined by while the number of fulltime jobs has increased by million during the period leading up to the startdate of obamacare as of early where fulltime jobs have turned into parttime jobs seems to be in the public sector as a result of efforts to reduce state and federal deficits rather than as an effort to maintain or increase corporate profits in the private sectors the original fear of individuals who coined the term obamacare effect similarly a study found only limited evidence that the aca had increased parttime employment several businesses and the state of virginia have clarified the contracts of their parttime employees by adding a houraweek capunreliable sourceunreliable source to reflect the hour threshold for fulltime hours as defined by the law some labor market experts claim such shifts are not clearly attributable to the implementation of the aca preexisting longterm trends in working hours and the effects of the great recession correlate with parttime working hour patterns the impact of this provision on employers decisionmaking is partially offset by other factors offering healthcare helps attract and retain employees while increasing productivity and reducing absenteeism and to trade a smaller fulltime workforce for a larger parttime work force carries costs of training and administration for a business the amount of employers with over employees is relatively clarification needed small and more than of these already offer insurance so changes in employer plans from this provision are expected to be small workers who do not receive insurance from an employer plan would be able to purchase insurance on the exchanges regardless of the rationale for maintaining existing insurance arrangements for those happy with them most policy analysts on both the right and left are critical of the employer mandate provision on the policy merits they argue that the perverse incentives regarding parttime hours even if they do not change many existing insurance plans are real and harmful that the raised marginal cost of the th worker for businesses could limit companies growth that the costs of reporting and administrationthe paperwork for businesses and the state enforcementare not worth the tradeoff of incentivizing the maintenance of current employer plans and note that the employer mandate unlike the individual mandate is a nonessential part of the law some analysts have suggested that an alternate pay or play version of the employer mandate would partially avoid these problems by instead taxing business that do not offer insurance by a percentage of their payroll rather than using the employee and hour cutoffs furthermore many healthcare policy analysts think it would be better to transition away from the employerbased system to systems whether state or marketbased where insurance is more portable and stable and hence think that it is a bad idea to even try to maintain existing employer insurance systems the effects of the provision have also generated vocal opposition from business interests and some unions not granted exemptions on july the obama administration announced on the treasury departments proposed regulations reg would delay the implementation of the employer mandate for one year until  a survey by the national association for business economics found that about percent of those surveyed said the aca hasnt influenced their planning or expectations for and percent said the law wouldnt prompt a change in their hiring practices some percent of businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and percent said it would be beneficial on february the treasury department issued treasury decision which are final regulation that it would delay the employer mandate until the treasury decision modifies proposed regulations reg at various times during and after the debate surrounding the aca obama stated that if you like your health care plan youll be able to keep your health care plan however the law grandfathers only those insurance plans that were in effect before the law was enacted and have not been significantly changed since then plans that do not satisfy these criteria must be cancelled if they do not comply with the laws new requirements for insurance standards furthermore the law does not prohibit insurers from cancelling older plans for other reasons such as a determination that a plan is too expensive to maintain for these reasons in fall millions of americans with individual policies received notices that their insurance plans were being terminated and several million more are in danger of seeing their current plans cancelled on november president obama stated i am sorry that people losing their plans are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me and he promised to work to help the affected americans various acts have been introduced in congress to allow people to keep their existing individual insurance plans president obamas previous unambiguous assurance that consumers could keep their own plans has become a focal point for critics of the aca and a political liability for the laws proponents whether or not president obama knew that his statements were incorrect at the time he made them has also become the focus of discussion the assetrecovery provision of medicaid nicknamed the clawback provision was enacted in by congress in response to rising medicaid administrative costs states were compelled to try to recover costs from the estates of the deceased who used the program for longterm care either via liens placed on an individuals home or claims on their assets there was also an option for states to recover other routine medical care expenses the expansion of medicaid under the affordable care act made more residents eligible for medicaid the state and federal government as of february have not clarified clawback guidelines triggering complaints from consumers and advocacy groups from the uncertainty from the start of to november hospitals in rural areas closed according to the north carolina rural health research program critics of the affordable care act have stated that the new law has caused these hospitals to close many of these rural hospitals were built using funds from the hillburton act to increase access to medical care in rural areas some of these hospitals have reopened as other forms of medical facilities but only a small number of those reopened facilities operate emergency rooms or urgent care centers since january a quarter of emergency room er doctors say they have seen a major surge in er patients while nearly half have seen a less significant increase in the number of patients seven in ten er doctors say they lack the resources to deal with large increases in the number of patients the biggest factor in the increased number of patients at ers is an insufficient number of primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients public opinion polls indicate that the united states public generally supports healthcare reform but the publics views became increasingly negative in reaction to specific plans discussed during the legislative debate over and polling statistics for the general population show a general negative opinion of the law in the first years with those in favor at approximately and those against at as of october about of whites approve of the law compared with of hispanics and of african americans according to a pew research center and usa today survey conducted on september usa today found opinions were strongly divided by age of the person at the laws inception with a solid majority of seniors opposing the bill and a solid majority of those younger than forty years old in favor specific elements are very popular across the political spectrum with the notable exception of the mandate to purchase insurance fivethirtyeight describing public opinion of the law said while surveys have consistently found that a plurality of americans have an overall negative view of the affordable care act they have just as consistently shown that large majorities of americans favor individual elements of the law for example a reutersipsos poll during june indicated that of americans supported the law with against by party affiliation of democrats of independents and of republicans favored the law overall individual provisions of the law received varying levels of support favored banning insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions favored allowing children to stay on their parents insurance until age supported requiring companies with more than employees to provide insurance for their employees and supported the individual mandate to own insurance or pay a penalty by party affiliation of republicans of independents and of democrats favored the mandate other polls showed additional provisions receiving majority support include the creation of insurance exchanges pooling small businesses and the uninsured with other consumers so that more people can take advantage of large group pricing benefits and providing subsidies to individuals and families to make health insurance more affordable other specific ideas that were not enacted but which showed majority support included importing prescription drugs from canada with its lower governmentcontrolled prices limiting malpractice awards reducing the age to qualify for medicare and the public health insurance option pollsters probed the reasons for opposition in a cnn poll of respondents said they thought the aca would increase the amount of money they personally spend on health care said the bill gives the government too much involvement in health care and said they thought they and their families would be better off with the legislation other polls found that people were concerned that the law would cost more than projected and would not do enough to control the cost of health care affecting their families however part of the opposition to the law is because some americans believe the reform did not go far enough a reutersipsos poll indicated that for those opposed to the bill of republican opponents reject it overall while believed it did not go far enough independent opponents were divided to and among the relatively much smaller group of democratic opponents reject it overall and wanted the measure to go further as of many democrats believed that the aca would grow more popular over time like medicare did after its implementation as the benefits of the law take effect and close the information gap about the contents of the bill in june a majority of the public indicated a desire for congress to implement or tinker with the law rather than repeal it following the supreme court upholding the constitutionality of the individual mandate in national federation of independent business v sebelius a poll released in july showed that most americans want to see critics of president obamas health care law drop efforts to block it and move on to other national issues the rand health reform opinion study for may showed that of respondents had an unfavorable view of the aca vs who had a favorable view of more than individuals polling averages from realclearpolitics showed public approval of the aca as against and for poll averages from february to march  an associated pressgfk poll released march showed that of americans support the aca a wall street journalnbc poll released april indicated that of respondents say that the affordable care act is working well the way it is by the end of a rasmussen option poll showed repeal leave as is improve ie wanted to leave the aca alone or improve upon it in june a cbs newsnew york times poll showed that of americans approved the health care law this was the first time that a major poll indicated that the number of americans who approved the aca is bigger than the ones who disapprove it though by a small margin the term obamacare was originally coined by opponents of the affordable care act as a pejorative term for the law the term was first put in print in march when healthcare lobbyist jeanne schulte scott penned it in a health industry journal writing we will soon see a giulianicare and obamacare to go along with mccaincare edwardscare and a totally revamped and remodeled hillarycare from the s according to research by elspeth reeve at the atlantic magazine the expression obamacare first was used in early generally by writers describing the candidates proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured the word was first uttered in a political campaign by mitt romney in may in des moines iowa romney said in my state i worked on healthcare for some time we had half a million people without insurance and i said how can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare and let me tell you if we dont do it the democrats will if the democrats do it it will be socialized medicine itll be governmentmanaged care itll be whats known as hillarycare or barack obamacare or whatever you want to call it by mid obamacare had become the most common colloquial term used to refer to the law by both supporters and opponents in contrast the use of patient protection and affordable care act or affordable care act became limited to more formal and official use use of the term in a positive sense was suggested by democrat john conyers president obama endorsed the nickname saying i have no problem with people saying obama cares i do care because of the number of obamacare search engine queries the department of health and human services purchased google advertisements triggered by the term to direct people to the official hhs site in march the obama reelection campaign embraced the term obamacare urging obamas supporters to post twitter messages that begin i like obamacare because after its debut as a phrase on capitol hill according to an analysis by the sunlight foundation from july to june the term obamacare was used nearly times in congressional speeches in october the associated press and npr began cutting back on use of the term stuart seidel nprs managing editor said that the term seems to be straddling somewhere between being a politicallycharged term and an accepted part of the vernacular on august sarah palin claimed the proposed legislation would create death panels that would decide if sick and elderly americans were worthy of medical care the allegation was named politifacts lie of the year one of factcheckorgs whoppers and the most outrageous term by the american dialect society the aarp described such rumors as rife with grossand even crueldistortions in the pew research center reported that of americans were familiar with the claim and believed it was true with three contemporaneous polls finding similar results a poll in august found that of americans still believed the death panels claim the death panel misconception distorts separate issues initially related to two proposed provisions found in the early drafts of the aca one was a claim that under the law seniors can be denied care due to their age and the other that the government will advise them to end their own lives instead of receiving due care the former eventually morphing into alluding to the independent payment advisory board ipab which was established with the passage of the aca instead the ipab has the authority to determine then recommend additional costsaving changes to the medicare program by facilitating the adoption of additional costeffective treatments and similar costrecovering measures when the statutory levels set for the administration of the medicare program are exceeded within any given year cycle scheduled in fact the board is prohibited from recommending changes that would reduce payments to certain providers before and is also prohibited from recommending changes in premiums benefits eligibility and taxes or other changes that would result in rationing the other related issue concerns advancecare planning consultation a section of the house reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing voluntary consultations of medicare recipients on endoflife health planning which is also covered by many private plans enabling patients to specify on request the kind of care they wish to receive in their old age as described by the site snopescom this provision would allow patients to prepare for the day when they might be seriously ill and unable to make medical decisions for themselves by engaging in consultations with doctors to discuss the full range of endoflife care options available to them and to have the cost of such consultations covered by medicare including directives to accept or refuse extreme lifesaving measures selection of hospice care programs appointment of relatives to act on the patients behalf etc the provision was not included in the final draft of the bill that was enacted into law the aca requires members of congress and their staffs to obtain health insurance either through an exchange or some other program approved by the law such as medicare instead of using the insurance offered to federal employees the federal employees health benefits program the federal government will continue to maintain its contributions to the new health insurance plans of federal employees the aca does not provide benefits to illegal immigrants although a poll found that believed that it does it explicitly denies insurance subsidies to unauthorized illegal aliens opposition and efforts to repeal the legislation have drawn support from a range of sources which includes labor unions prominent conservative advocacy groups congressional and many state republicans certain small business organizations and the tea party movement these groups believe the law will lead to disruption of existing health plans increased costs from new insurance standards and that it will increase the deficit some are also against the idea of universal healthcare viewing insurance as similar to other commodities to which people are not entitled as of update unions that have expressed concerns about the negative impact the aca will have on their members health care benefits included the aflcio which called the aca highly disruptive to union health care plans and said it would drive up costs of unionsponsored plans and international brotherhood of teamsters united food and commercial workers international union and unitehere leaders of which sent a letter to harry reid dnv and nancy pelosi dca arguing that the aca will shatter not only our hardearned health benefits but destroy the foundation of the hour work week that is the backbone of the american middle class in january terry osullivan president of the laborers international union of north america liuna and d taylor president of unite here sent a letter to harry reid dnv and nancy pelosi dca stating that the aca as implemented undermines fair marketplace competition in the health care industry opponents of the patient protection and affordable care act turned to the federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of the legislationnot in citation given in national federation of independent business v sebelius decided on june the supreme court ruled on a vote that the individual mandate is constitutional under congresss taxation powers although the law could not have been upheld under congresss regulatory power under the commerce clause the court also determined that states could not be forced to participate in the medicaid expansion effectively allowing states to opt out of this provision as written the aca withheld all medicaid funding from states declining to participate in the expansion the supreme court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out of the medicaid expansion without losing preexisting medicaid funding from the federal government all provisions of aca will continue in effect or will take effect as scheduled subject to the states determination on medicaid expansion in march the roman catholic church while supportive of the acas objectives has voiced concern through the united states conference of catholic bishops that aspects of the mandate covering artificial contraception and sterilization and hhss narrow definition of a religious organization were violations of the first amendment right to free exercise of religion and conscience numerous lawsuits are pending addressing these concerns on june the us supreme court ruled that federal subsidies for health insurance premiums could be used in the states that did not set up their own insurance exchanges following the supreme court ruling in nfib v sebelius several states with legislatures or governorships controlled by republicans opted to reject the expanded medicaid coverage provided for by the act over half of the national uninsured population lives in those states as of january update states and the district of columbia have adopted the medicaid expansion a few states have remained undecided states that declined to expand medicaid before may still choose to opt in at any time the drafters of the aca had intended for medicaid to cover individuals and families with incomes up to under effective definitions of income of the federal poverty level by expanding medicaid eligibility and simplifying the chip enrollment process lowincome individuals and families above and up to of the federal poverty level were to receive federal subsidies on a sliding scale if they choose to purchase insurance via an exchange for example individuals with incomes between and of the poverty level would be subsidized such that their premium cost would be to of their income the supreme court ruling created the potential for a coverage gap states that chose to reject the medicaid expansion could maintain the preexisting medicaid eligibility thresholds they have set which in many states are significantly below of the poverty line for most individuals furthermore many states do not make medicaid available to childless adults at any income level because subsidies on insurance plans purchased through exchanges are not available to those below the poverty line this created a coverage gap in those states between the state medicaid threshold and the subsidy eligibility threshold for example in kansas where only those ablebodied adults with children and with an income below of the poverty line are eligible for medicaid those with incomes from to of the poverty level to for a family of three would be ineligible for both medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance if they have no children ablebodied adults are not eligible for medicaid in kansas studies of the impact of state decisions to reject the medicaid expansion as of july calculate that up to million americans could fall into this coverage gap a commonwealth fund report found that if all states that had not expanded medicaid did so as many as million currently uninsured americans could gain insurance by  for states that do expand medicaid the federal government pays for of the expansion through and the subsidy tapers to by several opposing states argue that their responsibility of funding the expansion will be too much for their states budgets studies suggest that rejecting the expansion will cost states more than expanding medicaid due to increased spending on uncompensated emergency care that otherwise would have been partially paid for by medicaid coverage as well as deprive optingout states of federal funding that would benefit the states economies if they agreed to the expansion medicaid expansion has also been associated with increased tax revenue job growth and significant reductions in the expansion states uninsured population a study found that due to states not expanding medicaid million americans will remain uninsured and that this would lead to between and more deaths than if the states had agreed to expand medicaid officials in texas florida alabama wyoming arizona oklahoma and missouri have decided to oppose those elements of the aca over which they have discretion for example missouri declined to expand medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace but is also engaged in an active program of noncooperation having enacted a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law to the functioning of the affordable care act other republican politicians have tried to discourage efforts to advertise the benefits of the law and some conservative political groups have launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment the aca has been the subject of unsuccessful repeal efforts by republicans in the th th and th congresses us house reps steve king ria and michele bachmann rmn introduced bills in the house to repeal the aca the day after it was signed as did senator jim demint rsc in the us senate in after republicans gained control of the house of representatives one of the first votes held was on a bill titled repealing the jobkilling health care law act hr which the house passed on a vote all republicans and democrats voted for repeal house democrats proposed an amendment that repeal not take effect until a majority of the senators and representatives had opted out of the federal employees health benefits program republicans voted down the measure in the senate the bill was offered as an amendment to an unrelated bill but was voted down president obama had stated that he would have vetoed the bill even if it had passed both chambers of congress following the supreme court ruling upholding the aca as constitutional republicans held another vote to repeal the law on july the house of representatives voted with all republicans and democrats in favor of repeal which marked the rd partial or whole repeal attempt with president obamas reelection and the democrats expanding their majority in the senate following the elections many republicans conceded that repeal almost certainly will not occur on february the house of representatives added its th repeal vote to the record with to and nine members abstaining moving the action to the senate where republican senator ted cruz rtexas introduced legislation for full repeal with vote on september  strong partisan disagreement in congress has prevented adjustments to the acts provisions however at least one change a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices has received bipartisan support some congressional republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal republicans attempted to defund its implementation and in october house republicans supported by senators rand paul ted cruz mike lee and marco rubio refused to fund the federal government unless accompanied with a delay in implementation of the aca after the president unilaterally pushed back the employer mandate by one year which critics claim he had no legal right to do the republicanheld house of representatives passed three versions of a bill funding all elements of the government while submitting various versions that would repeal or delay the aca with the last version delaying enforcement of the individual mandate these bills were unable to muster enough votes in the democratheld senate with democratic leadership stating the senate would only pass a clean funding bill without any restrictions on the aca after congress failed to pass a continuing funding resolution by midnight on october a government shutdown ensued conservative groups such as heritage action provided lobbying support for the linkage between the aca and the government shutdown senate republicans threatened to block appointments to relevant agencies such as the independent payment advisory board and centers for medicare and medicaid services until passage of the aca the majority of us citizens had a company sponsored insurance plan and the us was the only rich nation where this was the case companies began offering insurance policies during world war ii to attract talent from the reduced supply of workers a practice later cemented by tax policies that encouraged untaxed benefits such as health care rather than taxable ones such as cash offering insurance in lieu of cash compensation made corporations responsible for their employees health rising insurance costs coupled with rising salaries squeezed both benefits and salaries until aging workers found their salaries stagnating and their benefits cut as of large company policies were still the norm since tax laws until make benefits cheaper than cash but many employees have been losing their paternalistic corporate policies and must find their own insurance with the insurance system introduced under the aca employers who stopped their company sponsored insurance plan eliminated one of their largest compensation benefits and shifted more costs on to employees these include insurance premiums rising to in compared with in according to the kaiser family foundation and more workers paying deductibles of reaching in more than twice what it was in according to one study as of only of firms saw themselves offering any insurance in years the cepr has found no evidence companies are reducing the hours of their workers to avoid the aca requirements for employees working over hours per week the house republican leadership put forth the argument in favor of repeal that this is a jobkilling law period they contended that the aca would lead to a loss of jobs attributing the figure to a report by the congressional budget office however factcheckorg noted that the figure was not included in the cbo report referred to saying that the republican statement badly misrepresents what the congressional budget office has said about the law in fact cbo is among those saying the effect on employment will probably be small politifact rated the republican statement as false jonathan cohn citing the projections of the cbo summarized that the primary employment effect of the aca is to alleviate job lock people who are only working because they desperately need employersponsored health insurance will no longer do so he concluded that the reforms only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire because they have health insurance outside of their jobs in may the nonpartisan congressional budget office cbo analyzed proposals to repeal the law mirroring its analysis of the law itself the cbo estimated that repealing the entire law both its taxing and spending provisions would increase the net federal deficit by billion revised cbo accounting following the july house repeal vote hr and taking into account the impact of supreme court ruling was consistent with its previous estimate that repeal would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of billion over the period

centuries during those years the united states evolved from a new nation fighting great britain for independence through the monumental american civil war and after collaborating in triumph during world war ii to the worlds sole remaining superpower from the late th century to present the continental congress in established the continental army and named general george washington its commander this newly formed army along with state militia forces and the french army and navy defeated the british in the new constitution in made the president the commander in chief with authority for the congress to levy taxes make the laws and declare war as of the us military consists of the army marine corps navy and air force all under the command of the united states department of defense there also is the united states coast guard which is controlled by the department of homeland security the president of the united states is the commander in chief and exercises the authority through the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff which supervises combat operations governors have control of each states army and air national guard units for limited purposes the president has the ability to federalize national guard units bringing them under the sole control of the department of defense the beginning of the united states military lies in civilian frontier settlers armed for hunting and basic survival in the wilderness these were organized into local militias for small military operations mostly against native american tribes but also to resist possible raids by the small military forces of neighboring european colonies they relied on the british regular army and navy for any serious military operation in major operations outside the locality involved the militia was not employed as a fighting force instead the colony asked for and paid volunteers many of whom were also militia members in the early years of the british colonization of north america military action in the thirteen colonies that would become the united states were the result of conflicts with native americans such as in the pequot war of king philips war in the yamasee war in and father rales war in  beginning in the colonies became involved in a series of wars between great britain and france for control of north america the most important of which were queen annes war in which the british conquered french colony acadia and the final french and indian war when britain was victorious over all the french colonies in north america this final war was to give thousands of colonists including virginia colonel george washington military experience which they put to use during the american revolutionary war ongoing political tensions between great britain and the thirteen colonies reached a crisis in when the british placed the province of massachusetts under martial law after the patriots protested taxes they regarded as a violation of their constitutional rights as englishmen when shooting began at lexington and concord in april militia units from across new england rushed to boston and bottled up the british in the city the continental congress appointed george washington as commanderinchief of the newly created continental army which was augmented throughout the war by colonial militia he drove the british out of boston but in late summer they returned to new york and nearly captured washingtons army meanwhile the revolutionaries expelled british officials from the states and declared themselves an independent nation on july  the british for their part lacked both a unified command and a clear strategy for winning with the use of the royal navy the british were able to capture coastal cities but control of the countryside eluded them a british sortie from canada in ended with the disastrous surrender of a british army at saratoga with the coming in of general von steuben the training and discipline along prussian lines began and the continental army began to evolve into a modern force france and spain then entered the war against great britain as allies of the us ending its naval advantage and escalating the conflict into a world war the netherlands later joined france and the british were outnumbered on land and sea in a world war as they had no major allies apart from indian tribes a shift in focus to the southern american states in resulted in a string of victories for the british but general nathanael greene engaged in guerrilla warfare and prevented them from making strategic headway the main british army was surrounded by washingtons american and french forces at yorktown in as the french fleet blocked a rescue by the royal navy the british then sued for peace general george washington proved an excellent organizer and administrator who worked successfully with congress and the state governors selecting and mentoring his senior officers supporting and training his troops and maintaining an idealistic republican army his biggest challenge was logistics since neither congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment munitions clothing paychecks or even the food supply of the soldiers as a battlefield tactician washington was often outmaneuvered by his british counterparts as a strategist however he had a better idea of how to win the war than they did the british sent four invasion armies washingtons strategy forced the first army out of boston in and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at saratoga and yorktown he limited the british control to new york and a few places while keeping patriot control of the great majority of the population the loyalists on whom the british had relied too heavily comprised about of the population but were never well organized as the war ended washington watched proudly as the final british army quietly sailed out of new york city in november taking the loyalist leadership with them washington astonished the world when instead of seizing power he retired quietly to his farm in virginia patriots had a strong distrust of a permanent standing army so the continental army was quickly demobilized with land grants to veterans general washington who throughout the war deferred to elected officials averted a potential coup dtat and resigned as commanderinchief after the war establishing a tradition of civil control of the us military following the american revolutionary war the united states faced potential military conflict on the high seas as well as on the western frontier the united states was a minor military power during this time having only a modest army marine corps and navy a traditional distrust of standing armies combined with faith in the abilities of local militia precluded the development of welltrained units and a professional officer corps jeffersonian leaders preferred a small army and navy fearing that a large military establishment would involve the united states in excessive foreign wars and potentially allow a domestic tyrant to seize power in the treaty of paris after the revolution the british had ceded the lands between the appalachian mountains and the mississippi river to the united states without consulting the shawnee cherokee choctaw and other smaller tribes who lived there because many of the tribes had fought as allies of the british the united states compelled tribal leaders to sign away lands in postwar treaties and began dividing these lands for settlement this provoked a war in the northwest territory in which the us forces performed poorly the battle of the wabash in was the most severe defeat ever suffered by the united states at the hands of american indians president washington dispatched a newly trained army to the region which decisively defeated the indian confederacy at the battle of fallen timbers in  when revolutionary france declared war on great britain in the united states sought to remain neutral but the jay treaty which was favorable to great britain angered the french government which viewed it as a violation of the treaty of alliance french privateers began to seize us vessels which led to an undeclared quasiwar between the two nations fought at sea from to the united states won a string of victories in the caribbean george washington was called out of retirement to head a provisional army in case of invasion by france but president john adams managed to negotiate a truce in which france agreed to terminate the prior alliance and cease its attacks the berbers along the barbary coast modern day libya sent pirates to capture merchant ships and hold the crews for ransom the us paid protection money until when president thomas jefferson refused to pay and sent in the navy to challenge the barbary states the first barbary war followed after the uss philadelphia was captured in lieutenant stephen decatur led a raid which successfully burned the captured ship preventing tripoli from using or selling it in after william eaton captured the city of derna tripoli agreed to a peace treaty the other barbary states continued to raid us shipping until the second barbary war in ended the practice by far the largest military action in which the united states engaged during this era was the war of with britain locked in a major war with napoleons france its policy was to block american shipments to france the united states sought to remain neutral while pursuing overseas trade britain cut the trade and impressed seamen on american ships into the royal navy despite intense protests britain supported an indian insurrection in the american midwest with the goal of creating an indian state there that would block american expansion the united states finally declared war on the united kingdom in the first time the us had officially declared war not hopeful of defeating the royal navy the us attacked the british empire by invading british canada hoping to use captured territory as a bargaining chip the invasion of canada was a debacle though concurrent wars with native americans on the western front tecumsehs war and the creek war were more successful after defeating napoleon in britain sent large veteran armies to invade new york raid washington and capture the key control of the mississippi river at new orleans the new york invasion was a fiasco after the much larger british army retreated to canada the raiders succeeded in the burning of washington on august but were repulsed in their chesapeake bay campaign at the battle of baltimore and the british commander killed the major invasion in louisiana was stopped by a onesided military battle that killed the top three british generals and thousands of soldiers the winners were the commanding general of the battle of new orleans major general andrew jackson who became president and the americans who basked in a victory over a much more powerful nation the peace treaty proved successful and the us and britain never again went to war the losers were the indians who never gained the independent territory in the midwest promised by britain with the rapid expansion of the farming population democrats looked to the west for new lands an idea which became known as manifest destiny in the texas revolution the settlers declared independence and defeated the mexican army but mexico was determined to reconquer the lost province and threatened war with the us if it annexed texas the us much larger and more powerful did annex texas in and war broke out in over boundary issues in the mexicanamerican war the us army under generals zachary taylor and winfield scott and others invaded and after a series of victorious battles and no major defeats seized new mexico and california and also blockaded the coast invaded northern mexico and invaded central mexico capturing the national capital the peace terms involved american purchase of the area from california to new mexico for million sectional tensions had long existed between the states located north of the masondixon line and those south of it primarily centered on the peculiar institution of slavery and the ability of states to overrule the decisions of the national government during the s and s conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent after the election of abraham lincoln in who southerners thought would work to end slavery states in the south seceded from the united states beginning with south carolina in late on april forces of the south known as the confederate states of america or simply the confederacy opened fire on fort sumter whose garrison was loyal to the union the american civil war caught both sides unprepared the confederacy hoped to win by getting britain and france to intervene or else by wearing down the norths willingness to fight the us sought a quick victory focused on capturing the confederate capital at richmond virginia the confederates under robert e lee tenaciously defended their capital until the very end the war spilled across the continent and even to the high seas most of the material and personnel of the south were used up while the north prospered the american civil war is sometimes called the first modern war due to the mobilization and destruction of the civilian base it also is characterized by many technical innovations involving railroads telegraphs rifles trench warfare and ironclad warships with turret guns after the civil war population expansion railroad construction and the disappearance of the buffalo herds heightened military tensions on the great plains several tribes especially the sioux and comanche fiercely resisted confinement to reservations the main role of the army was to keep indigenous peoples on reservations and to end their wars against settlers and each other william tecumseh sherman and philip sheridan were in charge a famous victory for the plains nations was the battle of the little big horn in when col george armstrong custer and two hundred plus members of the th cavalry were killed by a force consisting of native americans from the lakota northern cheyenne and arapaho nations the last significant conflict came in  the spanishamerican war was a short decisive war marked by quick overwhelming american victories at sea and on land against spain the navy was wellprepared and won laurels even as politicians tried and failed to have it redeployed to defend east coast cities against potential threats from the feeble spanish fleet the army performed well in combat in cuba however it was too oriented to small posts in the west and not as wellprepared for an overseas conflict it relied on volunteers and state militia units which faced logistical training and food problems in the staging areas in florida the united states freed cuba after an occupation by the us army by the peace treaty spain ceded to the united states its colonies of puerto rico guam and the philippines the navy set up coaling stations there and in hawaii which voluntarily joined the us in the us navy now had a major forward presence across the pacific and with the lease of guantnamo bay naval base in cuba a major base in the caribbean guarding the approaches to the gulf coast and the panama canal the philippineamerican war was an armed conflict between a group of filipino revolutionaries and the american forces following the ceding of the philippines to the united states after the defeat of spanish forces in the battle of manila the army sent in soldiers mostly from the national guard under general elwell otis defeated in the field and losing its capital in march the poorly armed and poorly led rebels broke into armed bands the insurgency collapsed in march when the leader emilio aguinaldo was captured by general frederick funston and his macabebe allies casualties included americans killed in action and who died from disease rebels were killed the navy was modernized in the s and by the s had adopted the naval power strategy of captain alfred thayer mahanas indeed did every major navy the old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships bringing them in line with the navies of britain and germany in most of the navys battleships with several support vessels dubbed the great white fleet were featured in a month circumnavigation of the world ordered by president theodore roosevelt it was a mission designed to demonstrate the navys capability to extend to the global theater secretary of war elihu root led the modernization of the army his goal of a uniformed chief of staff as general manager and a europeantype general staff for planning was stymied by general nelson a miles but did succeed in enlarging west point and establishing the us army war college as well as the general staff root changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service he also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line root was concerned about the armys role in governing the new territories acquired in and worked out the procedures for turning cuba over to the cubans and wrote the charter of government for the philippines rear admiral bradley a fiske was at the vanguard of new technology in naval guns and gunnery thanks to his innovations in fire control he immediately grasped the potential for air power and called for the development of a torpedo plane fiske as aide for operations in to assistant secretary franklin d roosevelt proposed a radical reorganization of the navy to make it a warfighting instrument fiske wanted to centralize authority in a chief of naval operations and an expert staff that would develop new strategies oversee the construction of a larger fleet coordinate war planning including force structure mobilization plans and industrial base and ensure that the us navy possessed the best possible war machines eventually the navy adopted his reforms and by started to reorganize for possible involvement in the world war then underway banana wars is an informal term for the minor intervention in latin america from until these include military presence in cuba panama with the panama canal zone haiti dominican republic and nicaragua the us marine corps began to specialize in longterm military occupation of these countries primarily to safeguard customs revenues which were the cause of local civil wars the moro rebellion was an armed insurgency between muslim filipino tribes in the southern philippines between and pacification was never complete as sporadic antigovernment insurgency continues into the st century with american advisors helping the philippine government forces the mexican revolution involved a civil war with hundreds of thousands of deaths and large numbers fleeing combat zones tens of thousands fled to the us president wilson sent us forces to occupy the mexican city of veracruz for six months in it was designed to show the us was keenly interested in the civil war and would not tolerate attacks on americans especially the april tampico affair which involved the arrest of american sailors by soldiers of the regime of mexican president victoriano huerta in early pancho villa a mexican general ordered soldiers on a murderous raid on the american city of columbus new mexico with the goal of robbing banks to fund his army the german secret service encouraged pancho villa in his attacks to involve the united states in an intervention in mexico which would distract the united states from its growing involvement in the war and divert aid from europe to support the intervention wilson called up the state militias national guard and sent them and the us army under general john j pershing to punish villa in the pancho villa expedition villa fled with the americans in pursuit deep into mexico thereby arousing mexican nationalism by early president venustiano carranza had contained villa and secured the border so wilson ordered pershing to withdraw the united states originally wished to remain neutral when world war i broke out in august however it insisted on its right as a neutral party to immunity from german submarine attack even though its ships carried food and raw materials to britain in the germans resumed submarine attacks knowing that it would lead to american entry when the us declared war the us army was still small by european standards and mobilization would take a year meanwhile the us continued to provide supplies and money to britain and france and initiated the first peacetime draft industrial mobilization took longer than expected so divisions were sent to europe without equipment relying instead on the british and french to supply them by summer a million american soldiers or doughboys as they were often called of the american expeditionary forces were in europe under the command of john j pershing with more arriving every week the failure of germanys spring offensive exhausted its reserves and they were unable to launch new offensives the german navy and home front then revolted and a new german government signed a conditional surrender the armistice ending the war against the western front on november  the socalled polar bear expedition was the involvement of us troops during the russian revolution in blocking the bolsheviks in arkhangelsk russia as part of the greater allied military expedition in the russian civil war the us sponsored a major world conference to limit the naval armaments of world powers including the us britain japan and france plus smaller nations secretary of state charles evans hughes made the key proposal of each country to reduce its number of warships by a formula that was accepted the conference enabled the great powers to reduce their navies and avoid conflict in the pacific the treaties remained in effect for ten years but were not renewed as tensions escalated after the costly us involvement in world war i isolationism grew within the nation congress refused membership in the league of nations and in response to the growing turmoil in europe and asia the gradually more restrictive neutrality acts were passed which were intended to prevent the us from supporting either side in a war president franklin d roosevelt sought to support britain however and in signed the lendlease act which permitted an expansion of the cash and carry arms trade to develop with britain which controlled the atlantic sea lanes roosevelt favored the navy he was in effective charge in world war i and used relief programs such as the pwa to support navy yards and build warships for example in he authorized million in pwa funds for thirtytwo new ships the army air corps received only million which barely covered replacements and allowed no expansion starting in months before pearl harbor the nation mobilized giving high priority to air power american involvement in world war ii in was limited to providing war material and financial support to britain the soviet union and the republic of china the us entered officially on december following the japanese attack on pearl harbor hawaii japanese forces soon seized american dutch and british possessions across the pacific and southeast asia except for australia which became a main american forward base along with hawaii the loss of eight battleships and americans at pearl harbor forced the us to rely on its remaining aircraft carriers which won a major victory over japan at midway just six months into the war and on its growing submarine fleet the navy and marine corps followed this up with an island hopping campaign across the central and south pacific in reaching the outskirts of japan in the battle of okinawa during and the us deployed millions of men and thousands of planes and tanks to the uk beginning with the strategic bombing of nazi germany and occupied europe and leading up to the allied invasions of occupied north africa in november sicily and italy in france in and the invasion of germany in parallel with the soviet invasion from the east that led to the surrender of nazi germany in may in the pacific the us experienced much success in naval campaigns during but bloody battles at iwo jima and okinawa in led the us to look for a way to end the war with minimal loss of american lives the us used atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki to destroy the japanese war effort and to shock the japanese leadership which quickly caused the surrender of japan the united states was able to mobilize quickly eventually becoming the dominant military power in most theaters of the war excepting only eastern europe and the industrial might of the us economy became a major factor in the allies mobilization of resources strategic and tactical lessons learned by the us such as the importance of air superiority and the dominance of the aircraft carrier in naval actions continue to guide us military doctrine into the st century world war ii holds a special place in the american psyche as the countrys greatest triumph and the us military personnel of world war ii are frequently referred to as the greatest generation over million served about of the population and over died during the war the us emerged as one of the two undisputed superpowers along with the soviet union and unlike the soviet union the us homeland was virtually untouched by the ravages of war during and following world war ii the united states and britain developed an increasingly strong defense and intelligence relationship manifestations of this include extensive basing of us forces in the uk shared intelligence shared military technology eg nuclear technology and shared procurement following world war ii the united states emerged as a global superpower visavis the soviet union in the cold war in this period of some forty years the united states provided foreign military aid and direct involvement in proxy wars against the soviet union it was the principal foreign actor in the korean war and vietnam war during this era nuclear weapons were held in ready by the united states under a concept of mutually assured destruction with the soviet union the national security act of meeting the need for a military reorganization to complement the us superpower role combined and replaced the former department of the navy and war department with a single cabinetlevel department of defense the act also created the national security council the central intelligence agency and the air force the korean war was a conflict between the united states and its united nations allies and the communist powers under influence of the soviet union also a un member nation and the peoples republic of china which later also gained un membership the principal combatants were north and south korea principal allies of south korea included the united states canada australia the united kingdom although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the united nations allies of north korea included the peoples republic of china which supplied military forces and the soviet union which supplied combat advisors and aircraft pilots as well as arms for the chinese and north korean troops the war started badly for the us and un north korean forces struck massively in the summer of and nearly drove the outnumbered us and rok defenders into the sea however the united nations intervened naming douglas macarthur commander of its forces and unusrok forces held a perimeter around pusan gaining time for reinforcement macarthur in a bold but risky move ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at inchon cutting off and routing the north koreans and quickly crossing the th parallel into north korea as un forces continued to advance toward the yalu river on the border with communist china the chinese crossed the yalu river in october and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the un forces reeling back across the th parallel truman originally wanted a rollback strategy to unify korea after the chinese successes he settled for a containment policy to split the country macarthur argued for rollback but was fired by president harry truman after disputes over the conduct of the war peace negotiations dragged on for two years until president dwight d eisenhower threatened china with nuclear weapons an armistice was quickly reached with the two koreas remaining divided at the th parallel north and south korea are still today in a state of war having never signed a peace treaty and american forces remain stationed in south korea as part of american foreign policy in the lebanon crisis of that threatened civil war operation blue bat deployed several hundred marines to bolster the prowestern lebanese government from july to october  on april marines were landed in santo domingo to evacuate the american embassy and foreign nationals after dissident dominican armed forces attempted to overthrow the ruling civilian junta by midmay peak strength of us soldiers marines and airmen were in the dominican republic and some naval ships were positioned offshore they evacuated nearly men women and children of nations and distributed more than million tons of food the vietnam war was a war fought between and on the ground in south vietnam and bordering areas of cambodia and laos see secret war and in the strategic bombing see operation rolling thunder of north vietnam american advisors came in the late s to help the rvn republic of vietnam combat communist insurgents known as viet cong major american military involvement began in after congress provided president lyndon b johnson with blanket approval for presidential use of force in the gulf of tonkin resolution fighting on one side was a coalition of forces including the republic of vietnam south vietnam or the rvn the united states supplemented by south korea thailand australia new zealand and the philippines the allies fought against the north vietnamese army nva as well as the national liberation front nlf also known as viet communists viet cong or vc a guerrilla force within south vietnam the nva received substantial military and economic aid from the soviet union and china turning vietnam into a proxy war the military history of the american side of the war involved different strategies over the years the bombing campaigns of the air force were tightly controlled by the white house for political reasons and until avoided the main northern cities of hanoi and haiphong and concentrated on bombing jungle supply trails especially the ho chi minh trail the most controversial army commander was william westmoreland whose strategy involved systematic defeat of all enemy forces in the field despite heavy american casualties that alienated public opinion back home the us framed the war as part of its policy of containment of communism in south asia but american forces were frustrated by an inability to engage the enemy in decisive battles corruption and incompetence in the army of the republic of vietnam and ever increasing protests at home the tet offensive in although a major military defeat for the nlf with half their forces eliminated marked the psychological turning point in the war with president richard m nixon opposed to containment and more interested in achieving dtente with both the soviet union and china american policy shifted to vietnamization providing very large supplies of arms and letting the vietnamese fight it out themselves after more than dead and many more wounded american forces withdrew in with no clear victory and in south vietnam was finally conquered by communist north vietnam and unified memories and lessons from the war are still a major factor in american politics one side views the war as a necessary part of the containment policy which allowed the enemy to choose the time and place of warfare others note the us made major strategic gains as the communists were defeated in indonesia and by both moscow and beijing were competing for american support at the expense of their allies in hanoi critics see the conflict as a quagmirean endless waste of american blood and treasure in a conflict that did not concern us interests fears of another quagmire have been major factors in foreign policy debates ever since the draft became extremely unpopular and president nixon ended it in forcing the military the army especially to rely entirely upon volunteers that raised the issue of how well the professional military reflected overall american society and values the soldiers typically took the position that their service represented the highest and best american values in october a violent power struggle threatened american lives in grenada neighboring nations asked the us to intervene the invasion was a hurriedly devised grouping of paratroopers marines rangers and special operations forces in operation urgent fury over a thousand americans quickly seized the entire island taking hundreds of military and civilian prisoners especially cubans in fighting between palestinian refugees and lebanese factions reignited that nations longrunning civil war a un agreement brought an international force of peacekeepers to occupy beirut and guarantee security us marines landed in august along with italian and french forces on october a suicide bomber driving a truck filled with tons of tnt crashed through a fence and destroyed the marine barracks killing marines seconds later a second bomber leveled a french barracks killing subsequently the us navy engaged in bombing of militia positions inside lebanon while us president ronald reagan was initially defiant political pressure at home eventually forced the withdrawal of the marines in february  codenamed operation el dorado canyon comprised the joint united states marine corps navy and air force airstrikes against libya on april the attack was carried out in response to the berlin discotheque bombing and resulted in the killing of officers and civilians on december the united states invaded panama mainly from us bases within the thencanal zone to oust dictator and international drug trafficker manuel noriega american forces quickly overwhelmed the panamanian defense forces noriega was captured on january and imprisoned in the us and a new government was installed the persian gulf war was a conflict between iraq and a coalition force of nations led by the united states the lead up to the war began with the iraqi invasion of kuwait in august which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the united nations against iraq the coalition commenced hostilities in january resulting in a decisive victory for the us led coalition forces which drove iraqi forces out of kuwait with minimal coalition deaths despite the low death toll over us veterans would later be classified as permanently disabled according to the us department of veterans affairs see gulf war syndrome the main battles were aerial and ground combat within iraq kuwait and bordering areas of saudi arabia land combat did not expand outside of the immediate iraqkuwaitsaudi border region although the coalition bombed cities and strategic targets across iraq and iraq fired missiles on israeli and saudi cities before the war many observers believed the us and its allies could win but might suffer substantial casualties certainly more than any conflict since vietnam and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of north africa during world war ii after nearly years of proxy wars and constant fears of another war in europe between nato and the warsaw pact some thought the persian gulf war might finally answer the question of which military philosophy would have reigned supreme iraqi forces were battlehardened after years of war with iran and they were well equipped with late model soviet tanks and jet fighters but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled in comparison the us had no largescale combat experience since its withdrawal from vietnam nearly years earlier and major changes in us doctrine equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire however the battle was onesided almost from the beginning the reasons for this are the subject of continuing study by military strategists and academics there is general agreement that us technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among iraqi troops which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership after devastating initial strikes against iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on january coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately the iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days with some planes fleeing to iran where they were interned for the duration of the conflict the overwhelming technological advantages of the us such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights quickly turned the air war into a turkey shoot the heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radarseeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft grainy video clips shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets were a staple of us news coverage and revealed to the world a new kind of war compared by some to a video game over weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters the iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat under orders from iraqi president saddam hussein and by the time the ground forces invaded on february many iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own in one instance iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces after just hours of ground combat and with all of kuwait and much of southern iraq under coalition control us president george h w bush ordered a ceasefire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities some us politicians were disappointed by this move believing bush should have pressed on to baghdad and removed hussein from power there is little doubt that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired still the political ramifications of removing hussein would have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region following the persian gulf war to protect minority populations the us britain and france declared and maintained nofly zones in northern and southern iraq which the iraqi military frequently tested the nofly zones persisted until the invasion of iraq although france withdrew from participation in patrolling the nofly zones in citing a lack of humanitarian purpose for the operation us troops participated in a un peacekeeping mission in somalia beginning in by the us troops were augmented with rangers and special forces with the aim of capturing warlord mohamed farrah aidid whose forces had massacred peacekeepers from pakistan during a raid in downtown mogadishu us troops became trapped overnight by a general uprising in the battle of mogadishu eighteen american soldiers were killed and a us television crew filmed graphic images of the body of one soldier being dragged through the streets by an angry mob somali guerrillas paid a staggering toll at an estimated total casualties during the conflict after much public disapproval american forces were quickly withdrawn by president bill clinton the incident profoundly affected us thinking about peacekeeping and intervention the book black hawk down was written about the battle and was the basis for the later movie of the same name operation uphold democracy september march was an intervention designed to reinstate the elected president jeanbertrand aristide who was reported to have died in office during the bombing of the presidential palace the operation was effectively authorized by the july united nations security council resolution  during the war in yugoslavia in the early s the us operated in bosnia and herzegovina as part of the natoled multinational implementation force ifor in operation joint endeavour the usa was one of the nato member countries who bombed yugoslavia between march and june during the kosovo war and later contributed to the multinational force kfor the war on terrorism is a global effort by the governments of several countries primarily the united states and its principal allies to neutralize international terrorist groups primarily islamic extremist terrorist groups including alqaeda and ensure that countries considered by the us and some of its allies to be rogue nations no longer support terrorist activities it has been adopted primarily as a response to the september attacks on the united states since terrorist motivated attacks upon service members have occurred in arkansas and texas the intervention in afghanistan operation enduring freedom afghanistan to depose that countrys taliban government and destroy training camps associated with alqaida is understood to have been the opening and in many ways defining campaign of the broader war on terrorism the emphasis on special operations forces sof political negotiation with autonomous military units and the use of proxy militaries marked a significant change from prior us military approaches in january the us sent more than troops later raised to to assist the armed forces of the philippines in combating terrorist groups linked to alqaida such as abu sayyaf under operation enduring freedom philippines operations have taken place mostly in the sulu archipelago where terrorists and other groups are active the majority of troops provide logistics however there are special forces troops that are training and assisting in combat operations against the terrorist groups with the emergence of isil and its capture of large areas of iraq and syria a number of crises resulted that sparked international attention isil had perpetrated sectarian killings and war crimes in both iraq and syria gains made in the iraq war were rolled back as iraqi army units abandoned their posts cities were taken over by the terrorist group which enforced its brand of sharia law the kidnapping and decapitation of numerous western journalists and aidworkers also garnered interest and outrage among western powers the us intervened with airstrikes in iraq over isil held territories and assets in august and in september a coalition of us and middle eastern powers initiated a bombing campaign in syria aimed at degrading and destroying isil and alnusraheld territory after the lengthy iraq disarmament crisis culminated with an american demand that iraqi president saddam hussein leave iraq which was refused a coalition led by the united states and the united kingdom fought the iraqi army in the invasion of iraq approximately united states troops with support from british australian and polish combat forces entered iraq primarily through their staging area in kuwait turkey had refused to permit its territory to be used for an invasion from the north coalition forces also supported iraqi kurdish militia estimated to number upwards of after approximately three weeks of fighting hussein and the baath party were forcibly removed followed by years of military presence by the united states and the coalition fighting alongside the newly elected iraqi government against various insurgent groups as a result of the libyan civil war the united nations enacted united nations security council resolution which imposed a nofly zone over libya and the protection of civilians from the forces of muammar gaddafi the united states along with britain france and several other nations committed a coalition force against gaddafis forces on march the first us action was taken when tomahawk missiles launched by us and uk warships destroyed shoreline air defenses of the gaddafi regime the us continued to play a major role in operation unified protector the natodirected mission that eventually incorporated all of the military coalitions actions in the theater throughout the conflict however the us maintained it was playing a supporting role only and was following the un mandate to protect civilians while the real conflict was between gaddafis loyalists and libyan rebels fighting to depose him during the conflict american drones were also deployed 
a progressive tax is a tax in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases the term progressive refers to the way the tax rate progresses from low to high with the result that a taxpayers average tax rate is less than the persons marginal tax rate the term can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole a year multiyear or lifetime progressive taxes are imposed in an attempt to reduce the tax incidence of people with a lower ability to pay as such taxes shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher abilitytopay the opposite of a progressive tax is a regressive tax where the relative tax rate or burden decreases as an individuals ability to pay increases the term is frequently applied in reference to personal income taxes in which people with lower income pay a lower percentage of that income in tax than do those with higher income it can also apply to adjustments of the tax base by using tax exemptions tax credits or selective taxation that creates progressive distribution effects for example a wealth or property tax a sales tax on luxury goods or the exemption of sales taxes on basic necessities may be described as having progressive effects as it increases the tax burden of higher income families and reduces it on lower income families progressive taxation is often suggested as a way to mitigate the societal ills associated with higher income inequality as the tax structure reduces inequality but economists disagree on the tax policys economic and longterm effects progressive taxation has also been positively associated with happiness the subjective wellbeing of nations and citizen satisfaction with public goods such as education and transportation in the early days of the roman republic public taxes consisted of assessments on owned wealth and property the tax rate under normal circumstances was of property value and could sometimes climb as high as in situations such as war these taxes were levied against land homes and other real estate slaves animals personal items and monetary wealth by bc rome no longer needed to levy a tax against its citizens in the italian peninsula due to the riches acquired from conquered provinces after considerable roman expansion in the st century augustus caesar introduced a wealth tax of about and a flat poll tax on each adult this made the tax system less progressive as it no longer only taxed wealth and closer to an income tax the first modern income tax was introduced in britain by prime minister william pitt the younger in his budget of december to pay for weapons and equipment for the french revolutionary war pitts new graduated progressive income tax began at a levy of old pence in the pound on incomes over as of and increased up to a maximum of shillings on incomes of over pitt hoped that the new income tax would raise million but actual receipts for totalled just over million pitts income tax was levied from to when it was abolished by henry addington during the peace of amiens addington had taken over as prime minister in after pitts resignation over catholic emancipation the income tax was reintroduced by addington in when hostilities recommenced but it was again abolished in one year after the battle of waterloo a tax on incomes over a certain amount is a two bracket graduated progressive tax similar to those still in use in sweden bottom brackets of are almost universal whether they are called earned income credits or appear explicitly in tax tables the united kingdom income tax was reintroduced by sir robert peel in the income tax act peel as a conservative had opposed income tax in the general election but a growing budget deficit required a new source of funds the new income tax based on addingtons model was imposed on incomes above as of although this measure was initially intended to be temporary it soon became a fixture of the british taxation system a committee was formed in under joseph hume to investigate the matter but failed to reach a clear recommendation despite the vociferous objection william gladstone chancellor of the exchequer from kept the progressive income tax and extended it to cover the costs of the crimean war by the s the progressive tax had become a grudgingly accepted element of the english fiscal system in the united states the first progressive income tax was established by the revenue act of this was signed into law by president abraham lincoln and repealed the flat tax which had been brought in under the revenue act of by the midth century most countries had implemented some form of progressive income tax indices such as the suits index gini coefficient kakwani index theil index atkinson index and hoover index have been created to measure the progressivity of taxation using measures derived from income distribution and wealth distribution the rate of tax can be expressed in two different ways the marginal rate expressed as the rate on each additional unit of income or expenditure or last dollar spent and the effective average rate expressed as the total tax paid divided by total income or expenditure in most progressive tax systems both rates will rise as the amount subject to taxation rises though there may be ranges where the marginal rate will be constant usually the average tax rate of a tax payer will be lower than the marginal tax rate in a system with refundable tax credits or incometested welfare benefits it is possible for marginal rates to fall as income rises at lower levels of incomecitation needed tax laws might not be accurately indexed to inflation for example some tax laws may ignore inflation completely in a progressive tax system failure to index the brackets to inflation will eventually result in effective tax increases if inflation is sustained as inflation in wages will increase individual income and move individuals into higher tax brackets with higher percentage rates this phenomenon is known as bracket creep and can cause fiscal dragcitation needed progressive taxation has a direct effect on reducing income inequality this is especially true if taxation is used to fund progressive government spending such as transfer payments and social safety nets however the effect may be muted if the higher rates cause increased tax evasion when income inequality is low aggregate demand will be relatively high because more people who want ordinary consumer goods and services will be able to afford them while the labor force will not be as relatively monopolized by the wealthy high levels of income inequality can have negative effects on longterm economic growth employment and class conflict progressive taxation is often suggested as a way to mitigate the societal ills associated with higher income inequality the difference between the gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation there is debate between politicians and economists over the role of tax policy in mitigating or exacerbating wealth inequality and the effects on economic growth for example economists thomas piketty and emmanuel saez wrote that decreased progressiveness in us tax policy in the post world war ii era has increased income inequality by enabling the wealthy greater access to capital conversely a report published by the oecd in presented empirical research showing a negative relationship between the progressivity of taxes and economic growth describing the research william mcbride a staff writer with the tax foundation stated that progressivity can undermine investment risktaking entrepreneurship and productivity because highincome earners tend to do much of the saving investing risktaking and highproductivity labor according to economist robert h frank tax cuts for the wealthy are largely spent on positional goods such as larger houses and more expensive cars frank argues that these funds could instead pay for things like improving public education and conducting medical research and suggests progressive taxation as an instrument for attacking positional externalities economist gary becker has described educational attainment as the root of economic mobility progressive tax rates while raising taxes on high income have the goal and corresponding effect of reducing the burden on low income improving income equality educational attainment is often conditional on cost and family income which for the poor reduces their opportunity for educational attainment increases in income for the poor and economic equality reduces the inequality of educational attainment tax policy can also include progressive features that provide tax incentives for education such as tax credits and tax exemptions for scholarships and grants a potentially adverse effect of progressive tax schedules is that they may reduce the incentives for educational attainment by reducing the aftertax income of highly educated workers progressive taxes can reduce the incentives for citizens to attain education thereby lowering the overall level of human capital in an economy however this effect can be mitigated by an education subsidy funded by the progressive tax theoretically public support for government spending on higher education increases when taxation is progressive especially when income distribution is unequal a social psychology study using data from countries found that progressive taxation was positively associated with the subjective wellbeing while overall tax rates and government spending were not the authors added we found that the association between moreprogressive taxation and higher levels of subjective wellbeing was mediated by citizens satisfaction with public goods such as education and public transportation tax law professor thomas d griffith summarizing research on human happiness has argued that because inequality in a society significantly reduces happiness a progressive tax structure which redistributes income would increase welfare and happiness in a society since progressive taxation reduces the income of high earners and is often used as a method to fund government social programs for low income earners calls for increasing tax progressivity have sometimes been labeled as envy or class warfare while others may describe such actions as fair or a form of social justice law professor marjorie kornhauser has suggested that much of the opposition to progressive taxation is caused by ignorance cognitive bias and inflammatory rhetoric and would be reduced if a nationwide education campaign taught the public about progressive taxation and told them that it benefits their selfinterests there are two common ways of computing a progressive tax corresponding to pointslope form and slopeintercept form of the equation for the applicable bracket these compute the tax either as the tax on the bottom amount of the bracket plus the tax on the marginal amount within the bracket or the tax on the entire amount at the marginal rate minus the amount that this overstates tax on the bottom end of the bracket for example suppose there are tax brackets of and where the rate applies to income from to the rate applies to income from to and the rate applies to all income above in that case the tax on of income computed by adding up tax in each bracket is the tax on of income could then be computed two ways using pointslope form tax on bottom amount plus tax on marginal amount yields geometrically the line for tax on the top bracket passes through the point and has a slope of  alternatively tax on yields which overstates tax on the bottom end of the top bracket by so using slopeintercept form yields geometrically the line for tax on the top bracket intercepts the yaxis at it passes through the point and has a slope of  in the united states the first form was used through for example for the single bracket from this changed to the second form for example for the single bracket most systems around the world contain progressive aspects when taxable income falls within a particular tax bracket the individual pays the listed percentage of tax on each dollar that falls within that monetary range for example a person in the us who earned us of taxable income income after adjustments deductions and exemptions would be liable for of each dollar earned from the st dollar to the th dollar and then for of each dollar earned from the st dollar to the th dollar for a total of  in the united states there are seven income tax brackets ranging from to above an untaxed level of income based on the personal exemption and usually various other tax exemptions such as the earned income tax credit and home mortgage payments the us federal tax system also includes deductions for state and local taxes for lower income households which mitigates what are sometimes regressive taxes particularly property taxes higher income households are subject to the alternative minimum tax that limits deductions and sets a flat tax rate of to with the higher rate commencing at in income there are also deduction phaseouts starting at for single filers the net effect is increased progressivity that completely limits deductions for state and local taxes and certain other credits for individuals earning more

religion in the united states is characterized by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices various religious faiths have flourished in the united states a majority of americans report that religion plays a very important role in their lives a proportion unique among developed countries historically the united states has always been marked by religious pluralism and diversity beginning with various native beliefs of the precolonial time in colonial times anglicans roman catholics and mainline protestants as well as jews arrived from europe eastern orthodoxy has been present since the russian colonization of alaska various dissenting protestants who left the church of england greatly diversified the religious landscape the great awakenings gave birth to multiple evangelical protestant denominations membership in methodist and baptist churches increased drastically in the second great awakening in the th century deism found support among american upper classes and thinkers the episcopal church usa splitting from the church of england came into being in the american revolution new protestant branches like adventism emerged restorationists and other christians like the jehovahs witnesses the latter day saint movement churches of christ and church of christ scientist as well as unitarian and universalist communities all spread in the th century pentecostalism emerged in the early th century as a result of the azusa street revival scientology emerged in the s unitarian universalism resulted from the merge of unitarian and universalist churches in the th century beginning in s the religious share of christians is decreasing due to secularization while islam hinduism buddhism and other religions are spreading protestantism historically dominant ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early s the majority of americans identify themselves as christians while close to a quarter claim no religious affiliation according to a study by the pew research center of the american population identified themselves as christians with professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered protestant and professing roman catholic beliefs the same study says that other religions including judaism buddhism islam and hinduism collectively make up about of the population according to a survey by the pew forum percent of americans state that they attend services nearly every week or more according to the gallup poll mississippi with of its population described as very religious say that religion is important to them and attend religious services almost every week is the most religious state in the country while vermont with only as very religious is the least religious state religion in the united states survey pew forum from early colonial days when some english and german settlers came in search of religious freedom america has been profoundly influenced by religion that influence continues in american culture social life and politics several of the original thirteen colonies were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion within a community of likeminded people the massachusetts bay colony was established by english puritans congregationalists pennsylvania by british quakers maryland by english catholics and virginia by english anglicans despite these and as a result of intervening religious strife and preference in england the plantation act would set official policy for new immigrants coming to british america until the american revolution the text of the first amendment to the countrys constitution states that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances it guarantees the free exercise of religion while also preventing the government from establishing a state religion however the states were not bound by the provision and as late as the s massachusetts provided tax money to local congregational churches the supreme court since the s has interpreted the fourteenth amendment as applying the first amendment to the state and local governments president john adams and a unanimous senate endorsed the treaty of tripoli in that stated the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion according to a survey by the pew forum nearly in americans said that religion plays an important role in their lives compared to in great britain in italy in germany in japan and in france the survey report stated that the results showed america having a greater similarity to developing nations where higher percentages say that religion plays an important role than to other wealthy nations where religion plays a minor role in of americans claimed to be christians while only professed no religious identity in the percentage of christians was closer to with close to claiming no religious identity the united states federal government was the first national government to have no official stateendorsed religion however some states had established religions in some form until the s modeling the provisions concerning religion within the virginia statute for religious freedom the framers of the constitution rejected any religious test for office and the first amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise thus protecting any religious organization institution or denomination from government interference the decision was mainly influenced by european rationalist and protestant ideals but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them the largest religion in the us is christianity claimed by the majority of the population in from those queried roughly of americans are protestants are catholics are mormons the name commonly used to refer to members of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints and have affiliations with various other christian denominations christianity was introduced during the period of european colonization according to a review by the national council of churches the five largest denominations are the southern baptist convention with over million adherents is the largest of more than distinctly named protestant denominations in members of evangelical churches comprised of the american population while another belonged to mainline protestant churches and belonged to historically black churches historians agree that members of mainline protestant denominations have played leadership roles in many aspects of american life including politics business science the arts and education they founded most of the countrys leading institutes of higher education according to harriet zuckerman of american nobel prize laureates between and have identified from protestant background episcopalians and presbyterians tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated than most other religious groups and numbers of the most wealthy and affluent american families as the vanderbilts and astors rockefeller du pont roosevelt forbes whitneys morgans and harrimans are mainline protestantism families though those affiliated with judaism are both the most educated and wealthiest religious group in the united states some of the first colleges and universities in america including harvard yale princeton columbia dartmouth williams bowdoin middlebury and amherst all were founded by mainline protestant denominations by the s most had weakened or dropped their formal connection with a denomination james hunter argues that beginning around european settlers introduced anglican and puritans religion as well as baptist presbyterian lutheran quaker and moravian denominations beginning in the th century the spanish and later the french and english introduced catholicism from the th century to the present catholics came to the us in large numbers due to immigration of italians hispanics portuguese french polish irish highland scots dutch flemish hungarians germans lebanese maronite and other ethnic groups eastern orthodoxy was brought to america by greek ukrainian armenian and other immigrant groups several christian groups were founded in america during the great awakenings interdenominational evangelicalism and pentecostalism emerged new protestant denominations such as adventism nondenominational movements such as the restoration movement which over time separated into the churches of christ the christian churches and churches of christ and the christian church disciples of christ jehovahs witnesses called bible students in the latter part of the th century and the church of jesus christ of latterday saints mormonism the strength of various sects varies greatly in different regions of the country with rural parts of the south having many evangelicals but very few catholics except louisiana and the gulf coast and the hispanic community which both consist mainly of catholics while urbanized areas of the north atlantic states and great lakes as well as many industrial and mining towns are heavily catholic though still quite mixed especially due to the heavily protestant africanamerican communities in nearly of the population of utah was mormon as well as of neighboring idaho lutheranism is most prominent in the upper midwest with north dakota having the highest percentage of lutherans according to a survey the largest religion christianity has proportionately diminished since while the absolute number of christians rose from to the percentage of christians dropped from to a nationwide telephone interview of adults conducted by the barna group found that of american adults believe that god is the allpowerful allknowing creator of the universe who still rules it today and that of all american adults and young adults hold to what the survey defined as a biblical worldview episcopalian presbyterian eastern orthodox and united church of christ members have the highest number of graduate and postgraduate degrees per capita of all christian denominations in the united states as well as the most highincome earners after christianity judaism is the next largest religious affiliation in the us though this identification is not necessarily indicative of religious beliefs or practices there are between and million jews a significant number of people identify themselves as american jews on ethnic and cultural grounds rather than religious ones for example of selfidentified american jews do not believe god exists the aris study projected from its sample that there are about million adults in the american jewish population million adults of the us adult population are estimated to be adherents of judaism million are estimated to be adherents of no religion and million are estimated to be adherents of a religion other than judaism aris estimated about million adults in the country identify judaism as their faith jews have been present in what is now the us since the th century and specifically allowed since the british colonial plantation act although small western european communities initially developed and grew largescale immigration did not take place until the late th century largely as a result of persecutions in parts of eastern europe the jewish community in the united states is composed predominantly of ashkenazi jews whose ancestors emigrated from central and eastern europe there are however small numbers of older and some recently arrived communities of sephardi jews with roots tracing back to th century iberia spain portugal and north africa there are also mizrahi jews from the middle east caucasia and central asia as well as much smaller numbers of ethiopian jews indian jews kaifeng jews and others from various smaller jewish ethnic divisions approximately of the jewish american population lives in new york city according to a survey conducted by the pew forum on religion and public life of adults in the us identify judaism as their religion among those surveyed said they were reform jews said they were conservative jews and said they were orthodox jews according to the national jewish population survey of jews were affiliated with the reform tradition were conservative were orthodox were reconstructionists linked themselves to some other tradition and said they are just jewish the pew research center report on american judaism released in october revealed that of jewish americans say they have no religion and the majority of respondents do not see religion as the primary constituent of jewish identity believe jewish identity is based primarily in ancestry and culture only in religion among jews who gave judaism as their religion based jewish identity on ancestry and culture and did not view belief in god as essential to judaism a study estimated the jewish population including both those who define themselves as jewish by religion and those who define themselves as jewish in cultural or ethnic terms to be between and million according to a study done in there were an estimated million jewish people in the country about of the population according to the national jewish population survey million american jewish adults have some sort of strong connection to the jewish community whether religious or cultural jewishness is generally considered an ethnic identity as well as a religious one among the million american jews described as strongly connected to judaism over have some sort of active engagement with judaism ranging from attendance at daily prayer services on one end of the spectrum to attending passover seders or lighting hanukkah candles on the other the survey also discovered that jews in the northeast and midwest are generally more observant than jews in the south or west reflecting a trend also observed among other religious groups jews in the northwestern united states are typically the least observant of tradition the jewish american community has higher household incomes than average and is one of the best educated religious communities in the united states islam is the third largest faith in the united states after christianity and judaism representing of the population islam in america effectively began with the arrival of african slaves it is estimated that about of african slaves transported to the united states were muslim most however became christians and the united states did not have a significant muslim population until the arrival of immigrants from arab and east asian muslim areas according to some experts islam later gained a higher profile through the nation of islam a religious group that appealed to black americans after the s its prominent converts included malcolm x and muhammad ali the first muslim elected in congress was keith ellison in followed by andr carson in  research indicates that muslims in the united states are generally more assimilated and prosperous than their counterparts in europe like other subcultural and religious communities the islamic community has generated its own political organizations and charity organizations the united states has perhaps the second largest bah community in the world first mention of the faith in the us was at the inaugural parliament of world religions which was held at the columbian exposition in chicago in in ibrahim kheiralla a syrian bah immigrant established a community in the us he later left the main group and founded a rival movement rastafarians began migrating to the united states in the s s and s from the religions s birthplace jamaica marcus garvey who is considered a prophet by many rastafarians rose to prominence and cultivated many of his ideas in the united states buddhism entered the us during the th century with the arrival of the first immigrants from east asia the first buddhist temple was established in san francisco in by chinese americans during the late th century buddhist missionaries from japan came to the us during the same time period us intellectuals started to take interest in buddhism the first prominent us citizen to publicly convert to buddhism was henry steel olcott in an event that contributed to the strengthening of buddhism in the us was the parliament of the worlds religions in which was attended by many buddhist delegates sent from india china japan vietnam thailand and sri lanka the early th century was characterized by a continuation of tendencies that had their roots in the th century the second half by contrast saw the emergence of new approaches and the move of buddhism into the mainstream and making itself a mass and social religious phenomenon estimates of the number of buddhists in the united states vary between and with reported by both the cia and pew the first time hinduism entered the us is not clearly identifiable however large groups of hindus have immigrated from india and other asian countries since the enactment of the immigration and nationality act of during the s and s hinduism exercised fascination contributing to the development of new age thought during the same decades the international society for krishna consciousness a vaishnavite hindu reform organization was founded in the us in there were an estimated hindus in the us about of the total population in the hindu american foundationa national institution protecting rights of the hindu community of uswas founded american hindus have one of the highest rates of educational attainment and household income among all religious communities and tend to have lower divorce rates adherents of jainism first arrived in the united states in the th century the most significant time of jain immigration was in the early s the united states has since become a center of the jain diaspora the federation of jain associations in north america is an umbrella organization of local american and canadian jain congregations to preserve practice and promote jainism and the jain way of life sikhism is a religion originating from south asia predominantly in modernday india which was introduced into the united states when around the turn of the th century sikhs started emigrating to the united states in significant numbers to work on farms in california they were the first community to come from india to the us in large numbersclarification needed the first sikh gurdwara in america was built in stockton california in in there were estimated to be between and sikhs living in the united states with the largest populations living on the east and west coasts with additional populations in detroit chicago and austin the united states also has a number of nonpunjabi converts to sikhism in there were an estimated taoists in the us taoism was popularized throughout the world through the writings and teachings of lao tzu and other taoists as well as the practice of qigong tai chi chuan and other chinese martial arts this group includes atheists agnostics and people who describe their religion as nothing in particular unaffiliated does not necessarily mean nonreligious some people who are unaffiliated with any particular religion express religious beliefs such as belief in one or more gods or in reincarnation and engage in religious practices such as prayercitation needed a survey directed by dr ariela keysar for the city university of new york indicated that amongst the more than categories of response no religious identification had the greatest increase in population in both absolute and percentage terms this category included atheists agnostics humanists and others with no stated religious preferences figures are up from million in to million in representing an increase from of the total population in to in a nationwide pew research study published in put the figure of unaffiliated persons at while another pew study published in was described as placing the proportion at about overall and roughly for the yearold demographic in a nationwide poll university of minnesota researchers found that despite an increasing acceptance of religious diversity atheists were generally distrusted by other americans who trusted them less than muslims recent immigrants and other minority groups in sharing their vision of american society they also associated atheists with undesirable attributes such as amorality criminal behavior rampant materialism and cultural elitism however the same study also reported that the researchers also found acceptance or rejection of atheists is related not only to personal religiosity but also to ones exposure to diversity education and political orientation with more educated east and west coast americans more accepting of atheists than their midwestern counterparts some surveys have indicated that doubts about the existence of a god were growing quickly among americans under  on march american atheists sponsored the reason rally in washington dc followed by the american atheist convention in bethesda maryland organizers called the estimated crowd of the largestever us gathering of atheists in one place in the united states enlightenment philosophy which itself was heavily inspired by deist ideals played a major role in creating the principle of religious freedom expressed in thomas jeffersons letters and included in the first amendment to the united states constitution american founding fathers or framers of the constitution who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy of deism include thomas jefferson benjamin franklin cornelius harnett gouverneur morris and hugh williamson their political speeches show distinct deistic influence other notable founding fathers may have been more directly deist these include thomas paine james madison possibly alexander hamilton and ethan allen various polls have been conducted to determine americans actual beliefs regarding a god

furthering spiritual growth spirituality places an emphasis upon the wellbeing of the mindbodyspirit so holistic activities such as tai chi reiki and yoga are common within the sbnr movement in contrast to religion spirituality has often been associated with the interior life of the individual one fifth of the us public and a third of adults under the age of are reportedly unaffiliated with

united states is represented by widely different movements and organizations the largest neopagan religion is wicca followed by neodruidism other neopagan movements include germanic neopaganism celtic reconstructionist paganism hellenic polytheistic reconstructionism and semitic neopaganism according to the american religious identification survey aris there are approximately druids in the united states modern druidism came to north america first in the form of fraternal druidic organizations in the nineteenth century and orders such as the ancient order of druids in america were founded as distinct american groups as early as in the reformed druids of north america rdna was founded by students at carleton college northfield minnesota they adopted elements of neopaganism into their practices for instance celebrating the festivals of the wheel of the year wicca advanced in north america in the s by raymond buckland an expatriate briton who visited gardners isle of man coven to gain initiation universal eclectic wicca was popularized in for a diverse membership drawing from both dianic and british traditional wiccan backgrounds a group of churches which started in the s in the united states is known under the banner of new thought these churches share a spiritual metaphysical and mystical predisposition and understanding of the bible and were strongly influenced by the transcendentalist movement particularly the work of ralph waldo emerson another antecedent of this movement was swedenborgianism founded on the writings of emanuel swedenborg in the new thought

the christian sciences the three major branches are religious science unity church and divine science unitarian universalists do not share a creed rather they are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth and by the understanding that an individuals theology is a result of that search and not obedience to an authoritarian requirement the first amendment guarantees both the free practice of religion and the nonestablishment of religion by the federal government later court decisions have extended that prohibition to the states the us pledge of allegiance was modified in to add the phrase under god in order to distinguish itself from the state atheism espoused by the soviet union various american presidents have often stated the importance of religion on february president dwight d eisenhower stated that recognition of the supreme being is the first the most basic expression of americanism president gerald ford agreed with and repeated this statement in  religion in the united states according to gallup inc  the us census does not ask about religion various groups have conducted surveys to determine approximate percentages of those affiliated with each religious group some surveys ask people to selfidentify while others calculate church memberships the first table below represents the ranges that have been found a survey reported that of americans attend religious services at least weekly it was conducted by the public religion research institute with a margin of error of  in an online harris poll they stated that the magnitude of errors cannot be estimated due to sampling errors nonresponse etc us adults were surveyed found that of those surveyed attended religious services every week or more often went once or twice a month went a few times a year went once a year went less than once a year and never attend religious services in a gallup international survey of american citizens said that they attended church or synagogue once a week or almost every week this percentage is higher than other surveyed western countries church attendance varies considerably by state and region the figures updated to ranged from in utah to in vermont in august of americans said religion was losing influence compared with who said this in majorities of white evangelical protestants white mainline protestants black protestants catholics and the religiously unaffiliated all agreed that religion was losing influence on american life of the total public said this was a bad thing while just see it as a good thing politicians frequently discuss their religion when campaigning and fundamentalists and black protestants are highly politically active however to keep their status as taxexempt organizations they must not officially endorse a candidate historically catholics were heavily democratic before the s while mainline protestants comprised the core of the republican party those patterns have faded awaycatholics for example now split about however white evangelicals since have made up a solidly republican group that favors conservative candidates secular voters are increasingly democratic only three presidential candidates for major parties have been catholics all for the democratic party joe biden is the first catholic vice president the only jewish major party candidate was joe lieberman in the gorelieberman campaign of although john kerry and barry goldwater both had jewish ancestry they were practicing christians in keith ellison of minnesota became the first muslim elected to congress

president up from in and  the republican presidential nominee mitt romney is mormon and a member of the the church of jesus christ of latterday saints he is the former governor of the state of massachusetts and his father george romney was the governor of the state of michigan the romneys were involved in mormonism in their states and in the state of utah the table below is based mainly on data reported by individual denominations to the yearbook of american and canadian churches and published in by the national council of churches of christ in usa it only includes religious bodies reporting or more members the definition of a member is determined by each religious body the association of religion data archives arda surveyed congregations for their memberships churches were asked for their membership numbers adjustments were made for those congregations that did not respond and for religious groups that reported only adult membership arda estimates that most of the churches not responding were black protestant congregations significant difference in results from other databases include the lower representation of adherents of all kinds christians protestants less than and the greater number of unaffiliated  the united states government does not collect religious data in its census the survey below the american religious identification survey aris of was a random digitdialed telephone survey of american residential households in the contiguous united states the sample size was sample size was  adult respondents were asked the openended question what is your religion if any interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers the religion of the spouse or partner was also asked if the initial answer was protestant or christian further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination about one third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions religious selfidentification of the us adult population figures are not adjusted for refusals to reply investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of no religion than any other group highlights the table below shows the religious affiliations among the ethnicities in the united states according to the pew forum survey people of black ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion with percent being christians

affirmative action in the united states is a set of laws policies guidelines and administrative practices intended to end and correct the effects of a specific form of discrimination these include governmentmandated governmentsanctioned and voluntary private programs that tend to focus on access to education and employment specifically granting special consideration to historically excluded groups such as racial minorities or women the impetus toward affirmative action is redressing the disadvantages associated with past and present discrimination further impetus is a desire to ensure public institutions such as universities hospitals and police forces are more representative of the populations they serve in the united states affirmative action tends to emphasize not specific quotas but rather targeted goals to address past discrimination in a particular institution or in broader society through goodfaith efforts to identify select and train potentially qualified minorities and women for example many higher education institutions have voluntarily adopted policies which seek to increase recruitment of racial minorities another example is executive orders requiring some government contractors and subcontractors to adopt equal opportunity employment measures such as outreach campaigns targeted recruitment employee and management development and employee support programs affirmative action policies were developed to address long histories of discrimination faced by minorities and women which reports suggest produced corresponding unfair advantages for whites and males they first emerged from debates over nondiscrimination policies in the s and during the civil rights movement these debates led to federal executive orders requiring nondiscrimination in the employment policies of some government agencies and contractors in the s onwards and to title vii of the civil rights act of which prohibited racial discrimination in firms with over employees the first federal policy of raceconscious affirmative action was the revised philadelphia plan which required government contractors to set goals and timetables for integrating and diversifying their workforce similar policies began to emerge through a mix of voluntary practices and federal and state policies in employment and education affirmative action as a practice was partially upheld by the supreme court in grutter v bollinger while the use of racial or gender quotas for college admissions was concurrently ruled unconstitutional by the court in gratz v bollinger  affirmative action is a subject of controversy in american politics opponents of affirmative action argue that these policies are outdated and lead to reverse discrimination which entails favoring one group over another based upon racial preference rather than achievement and many believe that the diversity of current american society suggests that affirmative action policies succeeded and are no longer required some policies adopted as affirmative action such as racial quotas or gender quotas have been criticized as a form of reverse discrimination scholars have also questioned whether quota systems and targeted goals can be clearly distinguished from each other ideas for affirmative action came as early as the reconstruction era in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living in general william tecumseh sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from georgia and grant it to families of color which became the forty acres and a mule policy the proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition nearly a century later ss policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the civil rights movement the civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the equal protection clause of the th amendment the decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory as well as voluntary programs affirmed the civil rights of people of color furthermore these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination the term originally appeared in united states law to refer to allow regulatory agencies such as the national labor relations board to require employers found in violating employment policies to take affirmative action on behalf of the victims of those violations such as reinstatement or backpay in president john f kennedy became the first to utilize the term affirmative action in its contemporary sense in executive order to ensure that government contractors take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin this executive order realized the governments intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people this executive order was eventually amended and superseded by lyndon b johnsons executive order which prevented discrimination based on race color religion and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts in the order was amended to include sex as well the reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of executive order but these contemplated changeswhich faced bipartisan opposition in congress the first appearance of the term affirmative action was in the national labor relations act better known as the wagner act of proposed and championed by us senator robert f wagner of new york the wagner act was in line with president roosevelts goal of providing economic security to workers and other lowincome groups during this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions the wagner act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against and empowered a national labor relations board to review potential cases of worker discrimination in the event of discrimination employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through affirmative action while the wagner act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities who exempting the congress of industrial organizations were often barred from union ranks this original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individuals unjust treatmentcitation needed fdrs new deal programs often contained equal opportunity clauses stating no discrimination shall be made on account of race color or creed but the true forerunner to affirmative action was the interior secretary of the time harold l ickes ickes prohibited discrimination in hiring for public works administration funded projects and oversaw not only the institution of a quota system where contractors were required to employ a fixed percentage of black workers by robert c weaver and clark foreman but also the equal pay of women proposed by harry hopkins fdrs largest contribution to affirmative action however lay in his executive order which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry or government the executive order promoted the idea that if taxpayer funds were accepted through a government contract then all taxpayers should have an equal opportunity to work through the contractor to enforce this idea roosevelt created the fair employment practices committee fepc with the power to investigate hiring practices by government contractors following the sergeant isaac woodard incident president harry s truman himself a combat veteran of world war i issued executive order establishing the presidents committee on civil rights to examine the violence and recommend appropriate federal legislation hearing of the incident truman turned to naacp leader walter francis white and declared my god i had no idea it was as terrible as that weve got to do something in the committee published its findings to secure these rights the book was widely read influential and considered utopian for the times in our land men are equal but they are free to be different from these very differences among our people has come the great human and national strength of america the report discussed and demonstrated racial discrimination in basic freedoms education public facilities personal safety and employment opportunities the committee was disturbed by the state of race relations and included the evacuation of americans of japanese descent during the war made without a trial or any sort of hearingfundamental to our whole system of law is the belief that guilt is personal and not a matter of heredity or association the recommendations were radical calling for federal policies and laws to end racial discrimination and bring about equality we can tolerate no restrictions upon the individual which depend upon irrelevant factors such as his race his color his religion or the social position to which he is born to secure these rights set the liberal legislative agenda for the next generation that eventually would be signed into law by lyndon b johnson to secure these rights also called for desegregation of the armed forces prejudice in any area is an ugly undemocratic phenomenon but in the armed services where all men run the risk of death it is especially repugnant the rationale was fairness when an individual enters the service of the country he necessarily surrenders some of the rights and privileges which are inherent in american citizenship in return the government undertakes to protect his integrity as an individual yet that was not possible in the segregated army since any discrimination whichprevents members of the minority groups from rendering full military service in defense of their country is for them a humiliating badge of inferiority the report called for an end to all discrimination and segregation based on race color creed or national origins inall branches of the armed services in truman and his advisors came up with a plan for a large standing military called universal military training and presented it to congress the plan opposed all segregation in the new postwar armed forces nothing could be more tragic for the future attitude of our people and for the unity of our nation than a citizens military that emphasized class or racial difference on february president truman delivered a special message to congress it consisted of ten objectives that congress should focus on when enacting legislation truman concluded by saying if we wish to inspire the peoples of the world whose freedom is in jeopardy if we wish to restore hope to those who have already lost their civil liberties if we wish to fulfill the promise that is ours we must correct the remaining imperfections in our practice of democracy in june truman became the first president to address the naacp his speech was a significant departure from traditional race relations in the united states in front of people at the lincoln memorial the president left no doubt where he stood on civil rights according to his speech america had reached a turning point in the long history of our countrys efforts to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizenseach man must be guaranteed equality of opportunity he proposed what black citizens had been calling for an enhanced role of federal authority through the states we must make the federal government a friendly vigilant defender of the rights and equalities of all americans and again i mean all americans on july truman mandated the end of hiring and employment discrimination in the federal government reaffirming fdrs order of he issued two executive orders on july executive order and executive order executive order named regulations governing for employment practices within the federal establishment instituted fair employment practices in the civilian agencies of the federal government the order created the position of fair employment officer the order established in the civil service commission a fair employment board of not less than seven persons executive order named establishing the presidents committee on equality of treatment and opportunity in the armed services called for the integration of the armed forces and the creation of the national military establishment to carry out the executive order on december truman issued executive order named improving the means for obtaining compliance with the nondiscrimination provisions of federal contracts which established an antidiscrimination committee on government contract compliance responsible for ensuring that employers doing business with the federal government comply with all laws and regulations enacted by congress and the committee on the grounds of discriminatory practices when eisenhower was elected president in he believed hiring practices and antidiscrimination laws should be decided by the states although the administration gradually continued to desegregate the armed forces and the federal government the president also established the government contract committee in which conducted surveys of the racial composition of federal employees and taxsupported contractors the committee chaired by vice president richard nixon had minimal outcomes in that they imposed the contractors with the primary responsibility of desegregation within their own companies and corporations in the presidential election democratic candidate and eventual winner john f kennedy criticized president eisenhower for not ending discrimination in federally supported housing and advocated a permanent fair employment practices commission shortly after taking office kennedy issued executive order in march requiring government contractors to consider and recommend additional affirmative steps which should be taken by executive departments and agencies to realize more fully the national policy of nondiscrimination the contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin the order also established the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity pceeo chaired by vice president lyndon b johnson federal contractors who failed to comply or violated the executive order were punished by contract cancellation and the possible debarment from future government contracts the administration was not demanding any special preference or treatment or quotas for minorities but was rather advocating racially neutral hiring to end job discrimination turning to issues of womens rights kennedy initiated a commission on the status of women in december the commission was charged with examining employment policies and practices of the government and of contractors with regard to sex in june president kennedy continued his policy of affirmative action by issuing another mandate executive order the order supplemented to his previous executive order declaring it was the policy of the united states to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination in employment through this order all federal funds such as grants loans unions and employers who accepted taxpayer funds and other forms of financial assistance to state and local governments were forced to comply to the governments policies on affirmative action in employment practices lyndon b johnson the texan democrat and senate majority leader from began to consider running for high office and in doing so showed how his racial views differed from those held by many white americans in the traditional south in johnson brokered a civil rights act through congress the bill established a civil rights division and commission in the justice department the commission was empowered to investigate allegations of minority deprivation of rights the first time affirmative action is used by the federal government concerning race is in president john f kennedys executive order which was chaired by vice president johnson at johnsons inaugural ball in texas he met with a young black lawyer hobart taylor jr and gave him the task to coauthor the executive order he wanted a phrase that gave a sense of positivity to performance under the order he was torn between the words positive action and affirmative action and selected the later due to its alliterative quality the term active recruitment started to be used as well this order albeit heavily worked up as a significant piece of legislation in reality carried little actual power the scope was limited to a couple hundred defense contractors leaving nearly billion in federal grants and loans unsupervised naacp had many problems with jfks token proposal they wanted jobs one day after the order took effect naacp labor secretary herbert hill filed complaints against the hiring and promoting practices of lockheed aircraft corporation lockheed was doing business with the defense department on the first billiondollar contract due to taxpayerfunding being of lockheeds business along with disproportionate hiring practices black workers charged lockheed with overt discrimination lockheed signed an agreement with vice president johnson that pledged an aggressive seeking out for more qualified minority candidates for technical and skill positions this agreement was the administrations model for a plan of progress johnson and his assistants soon pressured other defense contractors including boeing and general electric to sign similar voluntary agreements indicating plans for progress however these plans were just that voluntary many corporations in the south still afflicted with jim crow laws largely ignored the federal recommendations this eventually led to lbjs civil rights act which came shortly after president kennedys assassination this document was more holistic than any president kennedy had offered and therefore more controversial it aimed not only to integrate public facilities but also private businesses that sold to the public such as motels restaurants theaters and gas stations public schools hospitals libraries parks among other things were included in the bill as well it also worked with jfks executive order by prohibiting discrimination in the awarding of federal contracts and holding the authority of the government to deny contracts to businesses who discriminate maybe most significant of all title vii of the civil rights act aimed to end discrimination in all firms with or more employees another provision established the equal employment opportunity commission as the agency charged with ending discrimination in the nations workplace title vii was perhaps the most controversial of the entire bill many conservatives accused it of advocating a de facto quota system and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace minnesota senator hubert humphrey corrected this notion there is nothing in title vii that will give power to the commission to require hiring firing and promotion to meet a racial quota title vii is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications not race or religion title vii prohibits discrimination humphrey was the silent hero of the bills passing through congress he pledged that the bill required no quotas just nondiscrimination doing so he convinced many probusiness republicans including senate minority leader everett dirksen il to support title vii on july the act was signed into law by president johnson a harris poll that spring showed citizen approval of the act the strides that the johnson presidency made in ensuring equal opportunity in the workforce were further picked up by his successor nixon in the nixon administration initiated the philadelphia order it was regarded as the most forceful plan thus far to guarantee fair hiring practices in construction jobs philadelphia was selected as the test case because as assistant secretary of labor arthur fletcher explained the craft unions and the construction industry are among the most egregious offenders against equal opportunity laws openly hostile toward letting blacks into their closed circle the order included definite goals and timetables as president nixon asserted we would not impose quotas but would require federal contractors to show affirmative action to meet the goals of increasing minority employment it was through the philadelphia plan that the nixon administration formed their adapted definition of affirmative action and became the official policy of the us government the plan was defined as racial goals and timetables not quotas after the nixon administration advancements in affirmative action became less prevalent during the brief ford administration affirmative action took a back seat while enforcement stumbled along equal rights was still an important subject to many americans yet the world was changing and new issues were being raised people began to look at affirmative action as a glorified issue of the past and now there were other areas that needed focus of all the triumphs that have marked this as americas century none is more inspiring if incomplete than our pursuit of racial justice in the first half of the th century segregation was considered fair and normal fortunately because of changes made in american society and governmental policies the united states is past the traditional assumptions of race relations affirmative action has gone a long way to changing the definition of fairness and equality in america the concept and application of affirmative action has developed since its inception though its motivation remains the samecitation needed affirmative action is a national policy that concerns the way americans feel about race past discrimination preferences merit and about themselves this is why it is an american dilemma and that is why we must understand how it developed and how its rationale and definition have changed since the s in the beginning racial classifications that identified race were inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny these classifications would only be upheld if necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest later the us supreme court decided that racial classifications that benefited underrepresented minorities were to only be upheld if necessary and promoted a compelling governmental purpose see richmond v ja croson co there is no clear guidance about when government action is not compelling and such rulings are rare in arizona voters passed a constitutional ban on governmentsponsored affirmative action known as proposition  ricci v destefano was heard by the united states supreme court in the case concerns white and hispanic firefighters in new haven connecticut who upon passing their test for promotions to management were denied the promotions allegedly because of a discriminatory or at least questionable test the test gave whites and two hispanics the possibility of immediate promotion although of those taking the test were african american none scored high enough to qualify because of the possibility the tests were biased in violation of title vii of the civil rights act no candidates were promoted pending outcome of the controversy in a split vote the supreme court ruled that new haven had engaged in impermissible racial discrimination against the white and hispanic majority as of january house bill affirmative action is not allowed in college admissions and employment during november election poll majority of oklahoma voters voted yes to oklahoma affirmative action ban amendment which will end affirmative action in college admissions and employment president kennedy stated in executive order that discrimination because of race creed color or national origin is contrary to the constitutional principles and policies of the united states that it is the plain and positive obligation of the united states government to promote and ensure equal opportunity for all qualified persons without regard to race creed color or national origin employed or seeking employment with the federal government and on government contracts that it is the policy of the executive branch of the government to encourage by positive measures equal opportunity for all qualified persons within the government and that it is in the general interest and welfare of the united states to promote its economy security and national defense through the most efficient and effective utilization of all available manpower some individual american states also have orders that prohibit discrimination and outline affirmative action requirements with regard to race creed color religion sexual orientation national origin gender age and disability statuscitation needed proponents of affirmative action argue that by nature the system is not only race based but also class and gender based to eliminate two of its key components would undermine the purpose of the entire system the african american policy forum believes that the class based argument is based on the idea that nonpoor minorities do not experience racial and gender based discrimination the aapf believes that raceconscious affirmative action remains necessary to address racebased obstacles that block the path to success of countless people of color of all classes the groups goes on to say that affirmative action is responsible for creating the african american middle class so it does not make sense to say that the system only benefits the middle and upper classes a study conducted at the university of chicago in found that people with blacksounding names such as lakisha and jamal are percent less likely to be interviewed for a job compared to people with whitesounding names such as emily or greg a recent study by deirdre bowen tested many of the arguments used by the antiaffirmative action camp her research showed that minority students experience greater hostility and internal and external stigma in schools located in states that ban affirmative actionnot the schools where students may have benefited from affirmative action admissions supporters of affirmative action point out the benefits women gained from the policy as evidence of its ability to assist historically marginalized groups in the fifty years that disenfranchised groups have been the subject of affirmative action laws their representation has risen exponentially in the workforce thanks in large measure to affirmative action and civil rights protections that opened up previously restricted opportunities to women of all colors from   the percentage of women architects increased from to nearly of the total  the percentage of women doctors more than doubled from to of all doctors  the percentage of women lawyers grew from to of the national total  the percentage of female engineers went from less than to nearly   the percentage of female chemists grew from to of all chemists and  the percentage of female college faculty went from to of all faculty moseleybraun  for the first years of americas history blackamericans were traded as commodities and forced to work without pay first as indentured servants then as slaves in much of the united states at this time they were barred from all levels of education from basic reading to higherlevel skills useful outside of the plantation settingcitation needed after slaverys abolition in blackamericans saw the educational gap between themselves and whites compounded by segregation they were forced to attend separate underfunded schools due to plessy v ferguson though de jure school segregation ended with brown v board of education de facto segregation continues in education into the present daycitation needed following the end of world war ii the educational gap between white and black americans was widened by dwight d eisenhowers gi bill this piece of legislation paved the way for white gis to attend college despite their veteran status returning black servicemen were not afforded loans at the same rate as whites furthermore at the time of its introduction segregation was still the law of the land barring blacks from the best institutions overall nearly million servicemen and servicewomen were educated under the provisions of the gi bill after world war ii but for blacks higher educational opportunities were so few that the promise of the gi bill went largely unfulfilled according to a study by dr paul brest hispanics or latinos include immigrants who are descendants of immigrants from the countries comprising central and south america in mexican americans puerto ricans and cuban americans made up of the latino population in the united states latinos are disadvantaged compared to white americans and are more likely to live in poverty they are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a drop in high school completion rate while african americans experienced a increase between in they constituted of the population but only received of the bachelorss degrees awarded at times when it is favorable to lawmakers latinos were considered white by the jim crow laws during the reconstruction in other cases according to paul brest latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment housing and education brest finds that stereotypes continue to be largely negative and many perceive latinos as lazy unproductive and on the dole furthermore nativeborn latinoamericans and recent immigrants are seen as identical since outsiders tend not to differentiate between latino groups the category of native american applies to the diverse group of people who lived in north america before european settlement during the us governments westward expansion native americans were displaced from their land which had been their home for centuries instead they were forced onto reservations which were far smaller and less productive according to brest land belonging to native americans was reduced from million acres in to million acres in in the poverty rate for native americans was more than triple that of the whites and only of native americans have completed a bachelors degree as opposed to of whites and of african americans early asian immigrants experienced prejudice and discrimination in the forms of not having the ability to become naturalized citizens they also struggled with many of the same school segregation laws that african americans faced particularly during world war ii japanese americans were interned in camps and lost their property homes and businesses discrimination against asians began with the chinese exclusion act of and then continued with the scott act of and the geary act of at the beginning of the th century the united states passed the immigration act of to prevent asian immigration out of fear that asians were stealing white jobs and lowering the standard for wages in addition whites and nonasians do not differentiate among the different asian groups and perpetuate the model minority stereotype according to a article by professor qin zhang of fairfield university asians are characterized as one dimensional in having great work ethic and valuing education but lacking in communication skills and personality a negative outcome of this stereotype is that asians have been portrayed as having poor leadership and interpersonal skills this has contributing to the glass ceiling phenomenon in which although there are many qualified asian americans they occupy a disproportionately small number of executive positions in businesses furthermore the model minority stereotype has led to resentment of asian success and several universities and colleges have limited or have been accused of limiting asian matriculation proponents of affirmative action recognize that the policy is inherently unequal however minding the inescapable fact that historic inequalities exist in america they believe the policy is much more fair than one in which these circumstances are not taken into account furthermore those in favor of affirmative action see it as an effort towards inclusion rather than a discriminatory practice job discrimination is grounded in prejudice and exclusion whereas affirmative action is an effort to overcome prejudicial treatment through inclusion the most effective way to cure society of exclusionary practices is to make special efforts at inclusion which is exactly what affirmative action does there are a multitude of supporters as well as opponents to the policy of affirmative action many presidents throughout the last century have failed to take a very firm stance on the policy and the public has had to discern the presidents opinion for themselves bill clinton however made his stance on affirmative action very clear in a speech on july nearly two and a half years after his inauguration in his speech he discussed the history in the united states that brought the policy into fruition slavery jim crow and segregation clinton also mentioned a point similar to president lyndon b johnsons freedom is not enough speech and declared that just outlawing discrimination in the country would not be enough to give everyone in america equality he addressed the arguments that affirmative action hurt the white middle class and said that the policy was not the source of their problems clinton plainly outlined his stance on affirmative action saying let me be clear about what affirmative action must not mean and what i wont allow it to be it does not mean and i dont favor the unjustified preference of the unqualified over the qualified of any race or gender it doesnt mean and i dont favor numerical quotas it doesnt mean and i dont favor rejection or selection of any employee or student solely on the basis of race or gender without regard to merit in the end clinton stated that all the evidence shows that even though affirmative action should be a temporary policy the time had not come for it to be ended he felt it was still a relevant practice and overall the goal of the nation should be to mend it but dont end it clintons words became a slogan for many americans on the topic of affirmative action the national conference of state legislatures held in washington dc stated in a overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace by valuing diversity employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population by creating this diverse workforce these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy according to the us equal employment opportunity commission many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a company stronger more profitable and a better place to work therefore these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination but have shown the value in having diversity in the year according to a study by american association of university professors aaup affirmative action promoted diversity within colleges and universities this has been shown to have positive effects on the educational outcomes and experiences of college students as well as the teaching of faculty members according to a study by geoffrey maruyama and jos f moreno the results showed that faculty members believed diversity helps students to reach the essential goals of a college education caucasian students suffer no detrimental effects from classroom diversity and that attention to multicultural learning improves the ability of colleges and universities to accomplish their missions furthermore a diverse population of students offers unique perspectives in order to challenge preconceived notions through exposure to the experiences and ideas of others according to professor gurin of the university of michigan skills such as perspectivetaking acceptance of differences a willingness and capacity to find commonalities among differences acceptance of conflict as normal conflict resolution participation in democracy and interest in the wider social world can potentially be developed in college while being exposed to heterogeneous group of students in addition broadening perspectives helps students confront personal and substantive stereotypes and fosters discussion about racial and ethnic issues in a classroom setting furthermore the aaup study states that having a diversity of views leads to a better discussion and greater understanding among the students on issues of race tolerance fairness etc affirmative action has been the subject of numerous court cases where it is often contested on constitutional grounds some states specifically prohibit affirmative action such as california proposition washington initiative michigan michigan civil rights initiative and nebraska nebraska civil rights initiative a study by princeton sociologists thomas j espenshade and chang y chung compared the effects of affirmative action on racial and special groups at three highly selective private research universities the data from the study represent admissions disadvantage and advantage in terms of sat points on the old point scale in princeton sociologist thomas espenshade and researcher alexandria walton radford in their book no longer separate not yet equal examined data on students applying to college in and calculated that asianamericans needed nearly perfect sat scores of to have the same chance of being accepted at a top private university as whites who scored and african americans who got  after controlling for grades test scores family background legacy status and athletic status whether or not the student was a recruited athlete espenshade and radford found that whites were three times hispanics six times and blacks more than times as likely to be accepted at a us university as asian americans richard sander claims that artificially elevating minority students into schools they otherwise would not be capable of attending discourages them and tends to engender failure and high dropout rates for these students for example about half of black college students rank in the bottom percent of their classes black law school graduates are four times as likely to fail bar exams as are whites and interracial friendships are more likely to form among students with relatively similar levels of academic preparation thus blacks and hispanics are more socially integrated on campuses where they are less academically mismatched he claims that the supposed beneficiaries of affirmative action minorities do not actually benefit and rather are harmed by the policy sanders claims have been disputed and his empirical analyses have been subject to substantial criticism a group including some of the countrys lead statistical methodologists told the supreme court that sanders analyses were sufficiently flawed that the court would be wise to ignore them entirely a study by jesse rothstein and albert h yoon confirmed sanders mismatch findings but also found that eliminating affirmative action would lead to a percent decline in black matriculants at all law schools and a percent decline at elite law schools these high numbers predictions were doubted in a review of previous studies by peter arcidiacono and michael lovenheim their article found a strong indication that racial preference results in a mismatch effect however they argued that the attendance by some africanamerican law students to lessselective schools would significantly improve the low first attempt rate at passing the state bar but they cautioned that such improvements could be outweighed by decreases in law school attendance many scholars have found that minorities gain substantially from affirmative action the controversy surrounding affirmative actions effectiveness is based on the idea of class inequality opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle and upperclass african americans and hispanic americans at the expense of lowerclass european americans and asian americans this argument supports the idea of classbased affirmative action americas poor is disproportionately made up of people of color so classbased affirmative action would disproportionately help people of color this would eliminate the need for racebased affirmative action as well as reducing any disproportionate benefits for middle and upperclass people of color in a group of italian american professors at city university of new york asked to be added as an affirmative action category for promotion and hiring italian americans are usually considered white in the us and would not be covered under affirmative action policies but the professors believed they were underrepresented libertarian economist thomas sowell wrote in his book affirmative action around the world an empirical study that affirmative action policies encourage nonpreferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups ie primary beneficiaries of affirmative action to take advantage of group preference policies supreme court justice clarence thomas the only current black justice opposes affirmative action he believes the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment forbids consideration of race such as racebased affirmative action or preferential treatment he also believes it creates a cult of victimization and implies blacks require special treatment in order to succeed thomas also cites his own experiences of affirmative action programs as a reason for his criticism frederick lynch the author of invisible victims white males and the crisis of affirmative action did a study on white males that said they were victims of reverse discrimination lynch explains that these white men felt frustrated and unfairly victimized by affirmative action shelby steele another author against affirmative action wanted to see affirmative action go back to its original meaning of enforcing equal opportunity he argued that blacks had to take full responsibility in their education and in maintaining a job steele believes that there is still a long way to go in america to reach our goals of eradicating discrimination terry eastland the author who wrote from ending affirmative action the case for colorblind justice states most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it mostly middle class minorities additionally she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of selfdoubt and entitlement in minorities eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another libertarian economist thomas sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book affirmative action around the world an empirical study sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage nonpreferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups ie primary beneficiaries of affirmative action to take advantage of group preference policies that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group eg upper and middle class blacks often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the nonpreferred groups eg poor white or asian that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and nonpreferred to perform at their best the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well some commentators have defined reverse discrimination as a policy or practice in which members of a majority are discriminated against in favor of a historically disadvantaged group or minoritynonprimary source needed many argue that reverse discrimination results from affirmative action policies and that these policies are just another form of discrimination no different from examples in the past people like ward connerly assert that affirmative action requires the very discrimination it is seeking to eliminate according to these opponents this contradiction might make affirmative action counterproductive one argument for reverse discrimination is the idea that affirmative action encourages mediocrity and incompetence job positions would not be offered to the applicants who are the most qualified but to applicants with a special trait such as a certain race ethnicity or gender for example opponents say affirmative action causes unprepared applicants to be accepted in highly demanding educational institutions or jobs which result in eventual failure see for example richard sanders study of affirmative action in law school bar exam and eventual performance at law firms other opponents say that affirmative action lowers the bar and so denies those who strive for excellence on their own merit and the sense of real achievement opponents of affirmative action suggest that merit should be the primary factor considered in applying for job positions college graduate school etc others argue that affirmative action is no longer necessary and that the united states has become a melting pot of minorities to the extent that whites will eventually become the minority arguments are made that although affirmative action policies might have been necessary in the past they are now obsolete therefore these changing demographics demonstrate that affirmative action policies would become unnecessary since they would eventually benefit the majority another popular argument for affirmative action is compensation blacks were mistreated in the past for being black so society today should compensate for the injuries this causes reverse discrimination in the form of preferential hirings contracts and scholarships as a means to ameliorate past wrongs many opponents argue that this form of reparation is morally indefensible because if blacks were harmed for being black in the past then preferential treatment for this same trait is illogical in addition arguments are made that whites today who innocently benefited from past injustices should not be punished for something they had no control over therefore they are being reverse discriminated against because they are receiving the punishment that should be given to people who willingly and knowingly benefited from discriminatory practices some opponents further claim that affirmative action has undesirable sideeffects and that it fails to achieve its goals they argue that it hinders reconciliation replaces old wrongs with new wrongs undermines the achievements of minorities and encourages groups to identify themselves as disadvantaged even if they are not it may increase racial tension and benefit the more privileged people within minority groups at the expense of the disenfranchised within betteroff groups such as lowerclass whites and asiansthere has recently been a strong push among american states to ban racial or gender preferences in university admissions in reaction to the controversial and unprecedented decision in grutter v bollinger in nearly of michigan voters decided to ban affirmative action in university admissions michigan joined california florida texas and washington in banning the use of race or sex in admissions considerations some opponents believe among other things that affirmative action devalues the accomplishments of people who belong to a group its supposed to help therefore making affirmative action counterproductive furthermore opponents of affirmative action claim that these policies dehumanize individuals and applicants to jobs or school are judged as members of a group without consideration for the individual person critics of affirmative action assert that while supporters define diversity as heterogeneous in meaningful ways for example in skill set education work experiences perspectives on a problem cultural orientation and so forth the implementation is often solely based on superficial factors including gender race and country of origin in the us a prominent form of racial preferences relates to access to education particularly admission to universities and other forms of higher education race ethnicity native language social class geographical origin parental attendance of the university in question legacy admissions andor gender are sometimes taken into account when the university assesses an applicants grades and test scores individuals can also be awarded scholarships and have fees paid on the basis of criteria listed above in the supreme court ruled in bakke v regents that public universities and other government institutions could not set specific numerical targets based on race for admissions or employment the court said that goals and timetables for diversity could be set instead the racial preferences debate related to admission to us colleges and universities reflects competing notions of the mission of colleges to what extent should they pursue scholarly excellence to what extent civic goods and how should these purposes be balanced scholars such as ronald dworkin have asserted that no college applicant has a right to expect that a university will design its admissions policies in a way that prizes any particular set of qualities in this view admission is not an honor bestowed to reward superior merit but rather a way to advance the mission as each university defines it if diversity is a goal of the university and their racial preferences do not discriminate against applicants based on hatred or contempt then affirmative action can be judged acceptable based on the criteria related to the mission the university sets for itself consistent with this view admissions officers often claim to select students not based on academic record alone but also on commitment enthusiasm motivation and potential highly selective institutions of higher learning do not simply select only the highest sat performers to populate their undergraduate courses but high performers with scores of to points are extraordinarily wellrepresented at these institutions to accommodate the ruling in hopwood v texas banning any use of race in school admissions the state of texas passed a law guaranteeing entry to any state university if a student finished in the top of their graduating class florida and california have also replaced racial quotas with class rank and other criteria class rank tends to benefit top students at less competitive high schools to the detriment of students at more competitive high schools this effect however may be intentional since lessfunded less competitive schools are more likely to be schools where minority enrollment is high critics argue that class rank is more a measure of ones peers than of ones self the top rule adds racial diversity only because schools are still highly racially segregated because of residential patterns the class rank rule has the same consequence as traditional affirmative action opening schools to students who would otherwise not be admitted had the given school used a holistic meritbased approach from to texas had meritbased admission to its state universities and minority enrollment dropped the states adoption of the top percent rule returned minority enrollment to pre levels during a panel discussion at harvard universitys reunion for african american alumni during the academic year two prominent black professors at the institutionlani guinier and henry louis gatespointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at harvard they stated that only about a third of black harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the african american community the majority of black students at harvard were caribbean and african immigrants or their children with some others the mixedrace children of biracial couples one harvard student born in the south bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the united states for multiple generations said that there were so few harvard students from the historic african american community that they took to calling themselves the descendants ie descendants of american slaves the reasons for this underrepresentation of historic african americans and possible remedies remain a subject of debate ucla professor richard h sander published an article in the november issue of the stanford law review that questioned the effectiveness of racial preferences in law schools he noted that prior to his article there had been no comprehensive study on the effects of affirmative action the article presents a study that shows that half of all black law students rank near the bottom of their class after the first year of law school and that black law students are more likely to drop out of law school and to fail the bar exam the article offers a tentative estimate that the production of new black lawyers in the united states would grow by eight percent if affirmative action programs at all law schools were ended less qualified black students would attend less prestigious schools where they would be more closely matched in abilities with their classmates and thus perform relatively better sander helped to develop a socioeconomicallybased affirmative action plan for the ucla school of law after the passage of proposition in which prohibited the use of racial preferences by public universities in california this change occurred after studies showed that the graduation rate of blacks at ucla was compared to for whites a study in by mark long an economics professor at the university of washington demonstrated that the alternatives of affirmative action proved ineffective in restoring minority enrollment in public flagship universities in california texas and washington more specifically apparent rebounds of minority enrollment can be explained by increasing minority enrollment in high schools of those states and the beneficiaries of classbased not race affirmative action would be white students at the same time affirmative action itself is both morally and materially costly percent of white populace compared to percent of black thought it should be abolished implying white distaste of using racial identity and fullfile review is expected to cost the universities an additional million to million per year excluding possible cost of litigation in jian li a chinese undergraduate at yale university filed a civil rights complaint with the office for civil rights against princeton university claiming that his race played a role in their decision to reject his application for admission and seeking the suspension of federal financial assistance to the university until it discontinues discrimination against asian americans in all forms by eliminating race and legacy preferences princeton dean of admissions janet rapelye responded to the claims in the november issue of the daily princetonian by stating that the numbers dont indicate discrimination she said that li was not admitted because many others had far better qualifications lis extracurricular activities were described as not all that outstanding li countered in an email saying that his placement on the waitlist undermines rapelyes claim princeton had initially waitlisted my application li said so if it were not for a yield which was higher than expected the admissions office very well may have admitted a candidate whose outside activities were not all that outstanding in abigail fisher an undergraduate student at louisiana state university and rachel multer michalewicz a law student at southern methodist university filed a lawsuit to challenge the university of texas admissions policy asserting it had a raceconscious policy that violated their civil and constitutional rights the university of texas employs the top ten percent law under which admission to any public college or university in texas is guaranteed to high school students who graduate in the top ten percent of their high school class fisher has brought the admissions policy to court because she believes that she was denied acceptance to the university of texas based on her race and thus her right to equal protection according to the th amendment was violated the supreme court heard oral arguments in fisher on october and rendered an ambiguous ruling in that sent the case back to the lower court stipulating only that the university must demonstrate that it could not achieve diversity through other nonrace sensitive means in july the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit concluded that u of t maintained a holistic approach in its application of affirmative action and could continue the practice on february lawyers for fisher filed a new case in the supreme court it is a renewed complaint that the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit got the issue wrong on the second try as well as on the first the supreme court agreed in june to hear the case a second time it will likely be decided by june  on november students for fair admissions an offshoot of the project on fair representation filed lawsuits in federal district court challenging the admissions practices of harvard university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill the uncchapel hill lawsuit alleges discrimination against white and asian students while the harvard lawsuit focuses on discrimination against asian applicants both universities requested the court to halt the lawsuits until the us supreme court provides clarification of relevant law by ruling in fisher v university of texas at austin for the second time this supreme court case will likely be decided in june or slightly earlier in may a coalition of more than asianamerican organizations filed federal complaints with the education and justice departments against harvard university the coalition asked for a civil rights investigation into what they described as harvards discriminatory admission practices against asianamerican applicants the complaint asserts that recent studies indicate that harvard has engaged in systematic and continuous discrimination against asian americans in its holistic admissions process asianamerican applicants with nearperfect test scores toponepercent grade point averages academic awards and leadership positions are allegedly rejected by harvard because the university uses racial stereotypes racially differentiated standards and de facto racial quotas this federal complaint was dismissed in july because the students for fair admissions lawsuit makes similar allegations 
in the united states citizens are not automatically eligible for voting unless they registered at the county level the only exception is north dakota although local jurisdictions in north dakota may create such a requirement in most states citizens registering to vote may declare an affiliation with a political party this declaration of affiliation does not make the citizen a duespaying member of a party and may be changed at any time in many states only voters affiliated with a party may vote in that partys primary elections which are then called closed primaries it has been proposed by some that registration requirements contribute to discouraging people from exercising their right to vote thereby causing a lower voter turnout according to a study of the votingeligible population in the united states are not registered to vote equaling some million us citizens while voters traditionally had to register at government offices by a certain amount of time before the election in the mids the federal government made efforts to facilitate registering in an attempt to increase turnout the national voter registration act of the motor voter law forced state governments to either provide uniform optin registration services through drivers license registration centers disability centers schools libraries and mailin registration or to allow election day voter registration where voters can register at polling places immediately prior to voting in oregon became the first state to make voter registration fully automatic optout when issuing driver licenses and id cards political parties and other organizations sometimes hold voter registration drives organized efforts to register groups of new voters while the federal government has jurisdiction over federal elections most election laws are decided at the state level the united states constitution prohibits states from restricting voting rights in ways that infringe on a persons right to equal protection under the law th amendment on the basis of race th amendment on the basis of sex th amendment or on the basis of age for persons age and older th amendment the administration of elections may however vary widely across jurisdictions only us citizens have the right to vote in federal elections in a few cases permanent residents green card holders have registered to vote and have cast ballots generally without realizing that doing so was illegal noncitizens convicted in criminal court of having made a false claim of citizenship for the purpose of registering to vote in a federal election can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year deportation and removal proceedings have resulted from several such cases some states prohibit convicted felons from voting a practice known as felony disenfranchisement of these states some prohibit voting only during parole or probation but allow voting after a small number of states may require repeat offenders to have their voting rights restored through court action in many states citizens registering to vote may declare an affiliation with a political party this declaration of affiliation does not cost money and does not make the citizen a duespaying member of a party a party cannot prevent a voter from declaring his or her affiliation with them but it can refuse requests for full membership in some states only voters affiliated with a party may vote in that partys primary elections declaring a party affiliation is never required some states including georgia michigan minnesota virginia wisconsin and washington practice nonpartisan registration a study by the pew charitable trusts estimates that of the votingeligible population in the united states are not registered to vote a percentage that represents at least million eligible us citizens the study suggests that registration requirements contribute to discouraging people from exercising their right to vote thereby causing a lower voter turnout the extent of discouragement and its effect on increasing the socioeconomic bias of the electorate however remain contested in a landmark study raymond e wolfinger and steven j rosenstone came to the conclusion that less restrictive registration requirements would substantially increase the electoral turnout according to their probit analysis if all states adopted the procedures of the most permissive state regulations which would mean p turnout in the presidential election would have been higher with million additional people having voted in a seminal book sociologists richard cloward and francis fox piven argued that lowering registration requirements would improve socioeconomic equality in the composition of the electorate findings such as this have inspired lawmakers to facilitate the registration process eventually leading to the national voter registration act of or motor voter act that required states to allow voter registration at various public offices including drivers license registration centers disability centers schools libraries as well as mailin registration unless a state adopts election day voter registration the way towards passing this piece of federal legislation was however lengthy and rocky as these reforms were highly contested in an expanded edition of their book titled why americans still dont vote and why politicians want it that way cloward and piven argued that the reforms were expected to encourage lessprivileged groups which happen to lean towards the democratic party while the turnout at federal elections did substantially increase following the electoral reforms the effect fell short of wolfinger and rosenstones expectations while clowards and pivens hope of improving the demographic representativeness of the electorate wasnt fulfilled at all political scientist adam berinsky concluded in a article that the reforms designed to make voting easier in their entirety had an opposite effect actually increasing the preexisting socioeconomic biases by ensuring that those citizens who are most engaged with the political world those with politically relevant resources continue to participate whereas those individuals without such resources fall by the wayside as berinsky reaffirms in a piece the only way to increase turnout while improving representativeness is making more people become interested in politics traditionally voters have had to register at government offices to vote but in the mids the federal government made registering easier in an attempt to increase turnout the most prominent example was the national voter registration act of also known as the motor voter law which forced state governments to provide uniform optin registration services through drivers license registration centers disability centers schools libraries and mailin registration while the states with sameday registration on election day were exempt from these requirements an increasing number of states have begun to allow voter registration to take place entirely online as of may the states that have approved online registration are in oregon made voter registration fully automatic opt out when issuing driver licenses and id cards by april three more states california west virginia and vermont followed suit bringing the number of states with automatic voter registration to several more states have since created legislation proposing automatic registration as well the majority of states still require voters to register weeks before an election with various deadlines such as days or days some states allow election day voter registration also known as edr which enables eligible citizens to register to vote or update their registration when they arrive to vote it may also be called sameday registration sdr in states that allow voters to register and vote during the early voting period before election day edr allows eligible citizens to register or update their registration at the polls or their local election office by showing valid identification to a poll worker or election official who checks the identification consults the registration list and if they are not registered or the registration is out of date registers them on the spot eleven states currently have some form of edr colorado connecticut idaho illinois iowa maine minnesota montana new hampshire wisconsin wyoming and washington dc montana introduced edr in and iowa in in connecticut and california both implemented edr and connecticut started edr with its municipal elections in colorado followed enacting edr for the election illinois implemented a pilot in and made edr permanent starting in rhode island has edr for presidential elections california will start in or once it has implemented its statewide voter registration database north dakota unique among the states has no voter registration requirement at all in vermont will implement edr in and hawaii will do so in in june the maine legislature passed a law ending edr which had been in place since and abolishing absentee voting during the two business days before an election however the stipulation banning edr was overturned in a november citizen referendum peoples veto titled question when maine voters reinstated edr with in favor voter turnout is much higher in states using edr than in states that do not a report analyzing turnout in the united states presidential election had sdr states averaging at a turnout of well above the average voter turnout rate of for nonsdr states according to official turnout data report in the edition of america goes to the polls voter turnout in edr states has averaged percent higher than states that dont have that option research suggests that edr increases turnout between three and fourteen percentage points a study summarizes the impact of edr on voter turnout as about five percentage points political parties and other organizations sometimes hold voter registration drives organized efforts to register groups of new voters 
the use sale and possession of all forms of cannabis in the united states is illegal under federal law as a schedule i drug under the federal controlled substances act of cannabis legal term marijuana is considered to have no accepted medical use and have a high potential for abuse and physical andor emotional dependence cannabis use is illegal for any reason with the exception of fdaapproved research programs however states have created exemptions for various uses mainly medical and for industrial use cannabis for industrial uses hemp was made illegal to grow without a permit under the controlled substances act because of its relation to cannabis as a drug and any imported products must meet a zero tolerance level the agricultural act of allows for universities and state departments of agriculture to cultivate cannabis for research into its industrial potential as an intoxicant cannabis finds extensive favor among recreational and medical users in four states alaska colorado oregon and washington the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and nonmedical use and washington dc has legalized personal use but not commercial sale multiple efforts to reschedule cannabis under the controlled substances act have failed and the united states supreme court has ruled in united states v oakland cannabis buyers cooperative and gonzales v raich that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis whether medical or recreational as a result cannabis dispensaries are licensed by each state and sell cannabis products that have not been approved by the fda nor are legally registered with the federal government to sell controlled substances under federal law it is illegal to possess use buy sell or cultivate marijuana since the controlled substances act of classifies marijuana as a schedule i drug claiming it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use some states and local governments have established laws attempting to decriminalize cannabis which has reduced the number of simple possession offenders sent to jail since federal enforcement agents rarely target individuals directly for such relatively minor offenses other state and local governments ask law enforcement agencies to limit enforcement of drug laws with respect to cannabis however under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws in most cases the absence of a state law does not present a preemption conflict with a federal law in nevada voters defeated a ballot question which would legalize up to ounces g for adults and older for and against in a similar nevada ballot initiative which would have legalized and regulated the cultivation distribution and possession of up to ounce g of marijuana by adults and older was defeated for and against in south dakota voters defeated measure voting for and against measure was to allow the use of medical marijuana by patients deemed by their physicians to benefit from its use and was to be regulated by stateissued id cards and protection of legitimate medical distributors in july gil kerlikowske director of the office of national drug control policy clarified the federal governments position when he stated that marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit and that legalization is not in the presidents vocabulary and its not in mine however a january settlement between the us drug enforcement administration and the womens alliance for medical marijuana wamm provides an example confirming the administration policy as communicated by attorney general holder as wamm reached an agreement to reopen after being shut down by the federal government in  on november voters in colorado and washington approved measures that legalize nonmedical use of cannabisthe first states in the nation to do so after the election in the office of national drug control policy of the obama administration stated that it steadfastly opposes legalization of marijuana and other drugs because legalization would increase the availability and use of illicit drugs and pose significant health and safety risks in february the administration issued guidelines to banks for conducting transactions with legal marijuana sellers so these new businesses can stash away savings make payroll and pay taxes like any other enterprise however marijuana businesses still lack access to banks and credit unions due to federal reserve regulations according to a survey by pew research center a majority of americans are in favor of complete or partial legalization of cannabis the survey showed of respondents support cannabis legalization and do not college graduates support increased from to in just three years the support of selfidentified conservative republicans a group not traditionally supportive of cannabis legalization has increased to nearly and bipartisan support has increased across the board republican congressman dana rohrabacher introduced hr respect state marijuana laws on april with cosponsors of both major political parties the national center for natural products research in oxford mississippi is the only facility in the united states that is federally licensed by the national institute on drug abuse to cultivate cannabis for scientific research the center is part of the school of pharmacy at the university of mississippi roger roffman a professor of social work at the university of washington asserted in july that approximately million americans are daily or near daily users peter reuter a professor at the school of public policy and the department of criminology at the university of maryland college park said that experimenting with marijuana has long been a normal part of growing up in the us about half of the population born since has tried the drug by age a world health organization survey found that the united states is the worlds leading per capita marijuana consumer the national survey on drug use health prepared by the us department of human health and services indicated that million us citizens over the age of had used marijuana within a month the survey found that million americans were willing to tell government representatives that they had used marijuana in the past year according to the national survey on drug use and health by samhsa a branch of the us department of health and human services just over out of every of all americans or older have used cannabis at some point in their lives while about in reported using it this year in according to a zogby poll and an abc newswashington post poll between and of us voters would support legalization under federal law it is illegal to possess use buy sell or cultivate marijuana since the controlled substances act of classifies marijuana as a schedule i drug claiming it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use the federal government has criminalized marijuana under the interstate commerce clause and the application of these laws to intrastate commerce were addressed squarely by the united states supreme court in gonzales v raich f d in  in january president barack obamas transition team organized a poll to clarify some of the top issues the american public wants to have his administration look into and two of the top ten ideas were to legalize the use of cannabis in july gil kerlikowske director of the office of national drug control policy further clarified the federal governments position when he stated that marijuana is dangerous and has no medicinal benefit and that legalization is not in the presidents vocabulary and its not in mine however a january settlement between the us drug enforcement administration and the womens alliance for medical marijuana wamm provides an example confirming the administration policy as communicated by attorney general holder as wamm successfully reached an agreement to reopen after being shut down by the federal government in  on august a federal executive agency announced that it would no longer actively pursue marijuana offences taking place in the states that have legalized the small consumption and possession of marijuana the drug enforcement administration will only become involved if the offence involve violence or firearms the proceeds go to gangs and cartels or when marijuana is distributed to those states where it is illegal on december the department of justice told us attorneys to allow native american tribes on reservations to grow and sell marijuana even in states where it is illegal the policy will be implemented on a casebycase basis and tribes must still follow federal guidelines in congress quietly ended the federal governments ability to perform medical marijuana raids on march three us senators introduced the compassionate access research expansion and respect states act or carers act the bipartisan bill was introduced by senators rand paul kirsten gillibrand and cory booker the bill would move cannabis from schedule i to schedule ii of the controlled substances act this would allow states with medical cannabis laws to legally prescribe it and allow for much easier research into its medical efficacy the bill would also allow grow sites besides the university of mississippi which has been the sole supplier of cannabis for research to supply cannabis for study the federal government of the united states continues to argue that smoked cannabis has no recognized medical purpose pointing to a definition of medical purpose published by the dea not the food and drug administration the national institutes of health the centers for disease control or the office of the us surgeon general and the us public health service many officials point to the difficulty of regulating dosage a problem for treatment as well as research despite the availability in canada and the uk of dosagecontrolled sativex the united states has also pressured other governments especially canada and mexico with which it shares borders to retain restrictions on marijuana in four states colorado washington alaska and oregon the sale and possession of marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use and washington dc has legalized personal use but not commercial sale twentythree states and the district of columbia have passed laws allowing some degree of medical use of marijuana and states have taken steps to decriminalize it to some degree this movement sought to make simple possession of cannabis punishable by only confiscation or a fine rather than prison in the past several years the movement had started to have some successes some states and local governments have established laws attempting to decriminalize cannabis which has reduced the number of simple possession offenders sent to jail since federal enforcement agents rarely target individuals directly for such relatively minor offenses other state and local governments ask law enforcement agencies to limit enforcement of drug laws with respect to cannabis however under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution federal law preempts conflicting state and local laws in most cases the absence of a state law does not present a preemption conflict with a federal law in alaska marijuana was decidedly legal under state but not federal law for inhome personal use under the ravin v state ruling of this ruling allowed up to two ounces g of cannabis and cultivation of fewer than plants for these purposes a voter ballot initiative recriminalized marijuana possession but when that law was eventually challenged in the alaska courts upheld the ravin ruling saying the popular vote could not trump the state constitution in response to former governor frank murkowskis successive attempt to recriminalize cannabis the american civil liberties union aclu filed a lawsuit against the state on july superior court judge patricia collins awarded the case summary judgment to the aclu in her ruling she said no specific argument has been advanced in this case that possession of more than ounce g of cannabis even within the privacy of the home is constitutionally protected conduct under ravin or that any plaintiff or aclu of alaska member actually possesses more than ounce g of cannabis in their homes this does not mean that the legal possession threshold has been reduced to one ounce as this was a mere case summary review filed by the aclu not a full case reinforcing ravin collins wrote a lower court cannot reverse the state supreme courts decision in ravin v state and unless and until the supreme court directs otherwise ravin is the law in this state and this court is duty bound to follow that law the law regarding possession of cannabis has not changed in alaska and the supreme court has declined to review the case therefore the law still stands at ounces g however federal prosecutions under the csa can be brought in federal court and federal courts applying federal law are not bound by state court precedent as such federal courts in alaska will recognize that possession of any quantity of marijuana remains illegal in alaska under federal law it should be emphasized that legal possession of cannabis is strictly noncommercial the maximum legal limit is up to oz g or plants owned for personal use by adults in the privacy of their homes possessing more than oz g or more than cannabis plants is a felony punishable by up to years in jail and a fine of up to possession of any amount cannabis within ft m of a school or a recreation center is also a felony punishable by years jail time and a fine of up to but if possession is noncommercial and the offender is in their private residence an affirmative defense may be raised in court possession of marijuana for commercial reasons regardless of the amount is prohibited by law sale of less than

united states lawful permanent residency is the immigration status of a person authorized to live and work in the united states of america permanently a united states permanent resident card uscis form i formerly alien registration card or alien registration receipt card ins form i is an identification card attesting to the permanent resident status of an alien in the united states it is known informally as a green card because it was green from until and on may it was reverted to the color green green card also refers to an immigration process of becoming a permanent resident the green card serves as proof that its holder a lawful permanent resident lpr has been officially granted immigration benefits which include permission to reside and take employment in the united states the holder must maintain permanent resident status and can be removed from the united states if certain conditions of this status are not met green cards were formerly issued by the immigration and naturalization service ins the homeland security act of pub l no stat dismantled ins and separated the former agency into three components within the department of homeland security dhs the first the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis handles applications for immigration benefits two other agencies were created to oversee the inss former functions of immigration enforcement us immigration and customs enforcement ice and us customs and border protection cbp respectively permanent residents of the united states eighteen years of age or older must carry their actual green card at all times failing to do so is a violation of the immigration and nationality act carrying the possibility of a fine up to andor imprisonment for up to days for each offense only the federal government can impose these penalties green cards are valid for years for permanent residents and years for conditional permanent residents after this period the card must be renewed or replaced most of the information on the card is selfevident the computer and humanreadable signature at the bottom is not the format follows the machinereadable travel document td format a full list of category codes ie ir e etc can be found in the federal register or foreign affairs manual since may new green cards contain an rfid chip and can be electronically accessed at a distance they are shipped with a protective sleeve intended to protect the card from remote access a lawful permanent resident can apply for united states citizenship or naturalization after five years of residency this period is shortened to three years if married to a us citizen lawful permanent residents may submit their applications for naturalization as early as days before meeting the residency requirement in the united states million lawful permanent residents are eligible to naturalize citizens are entitled to more rights and obligations than permanent residents who are still classified as aliens in this respect lawful permanent residents generally do not have the right to vote the right to be elected in federal and state elections although even naturalized citizens cannot be elected president under article ii of the constitution the ability to bring family members to the united states permanent residents are allowed to sponsor certain family members but this is often not practical due to long approval delays or eligibility for federal government jobs male permanent residents between the ages of and are subject to registering in the selective service system permanent residents who reside in the united states must pay taxes on their worldwide income this includes filing annual us income tax returns like us citizens us immigration legislation in the immigration and nationality act ina stipulates that a person may obtain permanent resident status primarily through the course of the following proceedings an immigrant usually has to go through a threestep process to get permanent residency the whole process may take several years depending on the type of immigrant category and the country of chargeability an applicant alien in the united states can obtain two permits while the case is pending after a certain stage is passed in green card processing filing of i the first is a temporary work permit known as the employment authorization document ead which allows the alien to take employment in the united states the second is a temporary travel document advance parole which allows the alien to reenter the united states both permits confer benefits that are independent of any existing status granted to the alien for example the alien might already have permission to work in the united states under an hb visa us citizens may sponsor for permanent residence in the united states the following relatives us permanent residents may sponsor for permanent residence in the united states the following relatives the department of states visa bulletin issued every month gives the priority date for those petition beneficiaries currently entitled to apply for immigrant status through immigrant visas or adjustment of status there is no annual quota for the spouses unmarried children and parents of us citizens so there is no waiting period for these applicantsjust the required processing time however all other familybased categories have significant backlogs even with a us citizen petitioner regardless of whether the family member being sponsored is located in the united states and therefore likely to be applying for adjustment of status or outside the united states in which case the immigrant visa is the likely option the process begins with the filing of an i petition for alien relative the form and instructions can be found on the us citizenship and immigration services website required later in the process will be additional biographic data regarding the beneficiary the person being sponsored and a medical examination additional documents such as police certificates may be required depending on whether immigrant visa consular processing or adjustment of status is being utilized in the case of consular processing outside the united states one should ensure one is uptodate with the particular practices of the relevant us embassy or consulate all petitioners must supply the i affidavit of support green card holders married to nonus citizens are able to legally bring their spouses and minor children to join them in the usa but must wait for their priority date to become current the foreign spouse of a green card holder must wait for approval of an immigrant visa from the state department before entering the united states due to numerical limitation on the number of these visas the wait time for approval may be months or years in the interim the spouse cannot be legally present in the united states unless he or she secures a visa by some other means green card holders may opt to wait to become us citizens and only then sponsor their spouses and children as the process is much faster for us citizens however many green card holders can choose to apply for the spouse or children and update their application after becoming a us citizen the issue of us green card holders separated from their families for years is not a new problem a mechanism to unite families of green card holders was created by the life act by the introduction of a v visa signed into law by president clinton the law expired on december and v visas are no longer available from time to time bills are introduced in congress to reinstate v visas but so far none have been successful the most common challenges that uscis faces in providing services in the green card process are the length of the application and approval process and the quotas of green cards granted uscis tries to shorten the time qualified applicants wait to receive permanent residence under the current system immediate family members spouse child and dependent mother and father have priority status for green cards and generally wait months to a year to have their green card application approved for nonimmediate family members the process may take up to years paperwork is processed on a firstcome firstserved basis so new applications may go untouched for several months to address the issue of slow processing times uscis has made a policy allowing applicants to submit the i and i forms at the same time this has reduced the processing time another delay in the process comes when applications have mistakes in these cases papers are sent back to the applicant further delaying the process currently the largest issue creating long wait times is not processing time but rather immigrant visa quotas set by congress long wait times are a symptom of another issuequotas preventing immigrants from receiving immigrant visas georgias augusta chronicle in stated that an estimated two million people are on waiting lists in anticipation to become legal and permanent residents of the united states immigrants need visas to get off of these waiting lists and congress would need to change immigration law in order to accommodate them with legal status the number of green cards that can be granted to familybased applicants depends on what preference category they fall under an unlimited number of immediate relatives can receive green cards because there is no quota for that category family members who fall under the other various preference categories have fixed quotas however the number of visas issued from each category may vary because unused visas from one category may rollover into another category many immigrants opt for this route which typically requires an employer to sponsor ie to petition before uscis the immigrant known as the alien beneficiary through a presumed future job in some special categories the applicant may apply on hisher behalf without a sponsor the threestep process outlined above is described here in more detail for employmentbased immigration applications after the process is complete the alien is expected to take the certified job offered by the employer to substantiate his or her immigrant status since the application ultimately rests on the aliens employment with that company in that particular position each year around immigrant visas are made available through the diversity visa dv program also known as the green card lottery to people who were born in countries with low rates of immigration to the united states fewer than immigrants in the past five years applicants can only qualify by country of chargeability not by citizenship anyone who is selected under this lottery will be given the opportunity to apply for permanent residence they can also file for their spouse and any unmarried children under the age of  if permanent residence is granted the winner and hisher family if applicable receives an immigrant visa in their passports that has to be activated within six months of issuance at any port of entry to the united states if already in the us adjustment of status may be pursued the new immigrant receives a stamp on the visa as proof of lawful admittance to the united states and the individual is now authorized to live and work permanently in the united states finally the actual green card typically arrives by mail within a few months over million applications for the fiscal year fy diversity visa lottery were submitted this is an increase from the more than million applications submitted in the diversity visa lottery taking into account dependents there are more than million participants in the diversity visa lottery most of the applications were from africa and asia percent of the total came from africa percent from asia percent coming from europe and two percent from south america central america and the caribbean the largest number of applicants came from bangladesh more than million applicants followed by nigeria and ukraine  normally somewhat fewer than applicants will be announced as winners to ensure that all green cards will be issued for the fiscal year there were bangladesh nigerian and of the ukrainian applications declared as winners of these there were finally used of the bangladesh winner numbers of the nigerian winner numbers and of the ukrainian winner numbers to get a green card within the time limit at the end were issued in fy less than planned therefore the chances to become a winner in a lottery differs from the country of origin for which you are filed for it also differs from year to year over million applications for the diversity visa lottery were submitted this is an increase from the more than million applications submitted in the diversity visa lottery taking into account dependents there are more than million participants in the diversity visa lottery the largest number of applicants came from bangladesh more than million applicants followed by nigeria and ukraine  there is a growing number of fraudulent green card lottery scams in which false agents take money from applicants by promising to submit application forms for them most agents are not working for the distribution service some claim that they can increase the chance of winning the lottery this is not true in fact they may delay or not submit the application likewise some claim to provide to winners free airline tickets or other benefits such as submissions in future years or cash funds there is no way to guarantee their claims and there are numerous nefarious reasons for them not to fulfill their promises applicants are advised to use only official us government websites in which the url ends in gov other fraud perpetrators will email potential victims posing as state department or other government officials with requests to wire or transfer money online as part of a processing fee these fraudulent emails are designed to steal money from unsuspecting victims the senders often use

report fraudulent emails to the authorities the department of state the department of homeland security and the federal trade commission have issued warnings about this type of fraud or similar business practices the registry is a provision of the immigration and nationality act which allows a person who have previously entered the united states illegally to obtain legal permanent residence simply on the basis of having de facto resided in the country over a long time to avail himself of the benefit of this provision the immigrant has to prove that he has continuously resided since before the stipulated registry date the concept of registry was first added to the ina in with the registry date set to june since then the registry date has been adjusted several times being set to july june and june the most recent adjustment to the registry date came with the immigration reform and control act of when it was set to january a number of bills have been introduced in congress since then to further alter the registry date but they have not been passed as part of immigration reform under the immigration reform and control act of irca as well as further reform enacted in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iiraira persons who are eligible and properly apply for permanent residence based on either a recent marriage to a us citizen or as an investor are granted permanent residence only on a conditional basis for two years an exception to this rule is the case of a us citizen legally sponsoring a spouse in which the marriage at the time of the adjustment of status i is more than two years old in this case the conditional status is waived and a year permanent resident card is issued upon uscis approval of the case a permanent resident under the conditional clause may receive an i stamp as well as a permanent resident card the expiration date of the conditional period is two years from the approval date the immigrant visa category is cr conditional resident when this twoyear conditional period is over the permanent residence automatically expires and the applicant is subject to deportation and removal to avoid this days or less before the conditional residence expires the applicant must file form i petition to remove conditions on residence if conditional permanent residence was obtained through marriage or form i petition by entrepreneur to remove conditions if conditional permanent residence was obtained through investment with uscis to have the conditions removed once the application is received permanent residence is extended in year intervals until the request to remove conditions is approved or denied for conditional permanent residence obtained through marriage both spouses must sign the form i if the spouses are divorced it is possible to get a waiver of the other spouses signing requirement if it can be proved that the marriage was bona fide the uscis requires that the application for the removal of conditions provide both general and specific supporting evidence that the basis on which the applicant obtained conditional permanent residence was not fraudulent for an application based on marriage birth certificates of children joint financial statements and letters from employers friends and relatives are some types of evidence that may be accepted this is to ensure that the marriage was in good faith and not a fraudulent marriage of convenience with a sole intention of obtaining a green card a followup interview with an immigration officer is sometimes required but may be waived if the submitted evidence is sufficient both the spouses must attend the interview under most circumstances the applicant receives an i stamp in their foreign passport upon approval of their case the applicant is then free from the conditional requirement once the application is approved the applicants new permanent resident card arrives via mail to their residence several weeks to several months later and replaces the old twoyear conditional residence card this new card must be renewed after years but permanent resident status is now granted for an indefinite term if residence conditions are satisfied at all times uscis may request to renew the card earlier because of security enhancements of the card or as a part of a revalidation campaign to exclude counterfeit green cards from circulation it is important to note that this twoyear conditional residence period counts toward satisfying a residency requirement for us naturalization and other purposes application for the removal of conditions must be adjudicated before a separate naturalization application could be reviewed by uscis on its own merits conditional permanent residents have all of the equal rights privileges responsibilities and duties which apply to all other lawful permanent residents the only difference is the requirement to remove the conditions for example show marriage status or satisfy entrepreneur requirements before the twoyear period has ended in order to prevent removal all other rights remain the same a green card holder may abandon permanent residence by filing form i with the green card at a us embassy under certain conditions permanent residence status can be lost involuntarily this includes committing a criminal act that makes a person removable from the united states a person might also be found to have abandoned hisher status if he or she moves to another country to live there permanently stays outside the usa for more than days without getting a reentry permit before leaving or does not file an income tax return on their worldwide income permanent resident status can also be lost if it is found that the application or grounds for obtaining permanent residence was fraudulent the failure to renew the permanent resident card does not result in the loss of status except in the case of conditional permanent residents as noted above nevertheless it is still a good idea to renew the green card on time because it also acts as a work permit and travel permit advance parole but if the green card is renewed late there is no penalty or extra fee to pay a person who loses permanent residence status is immediately removable from the united states and must leave the country as soon as possible or face deportation and removal in some cases the person may be banned from entering the country for three or seven years or even permanently due to the heart act foreign workers who have owned a green card in eight of the last years and choose to relinquish it will be subject to the expatriation tax which taxes unrealized gains above anywhere in the world however this will only apply to those people who have a federal tax liability greater than a year or have a worth of more than million or have failed to certify to the irs that they have been in compliance with us federal tax obligations for the past five years if the green card is not relinquished then the holder is subject to double taxation when living or working outside of the united states whether or not within their home nation although double taxation may be mitigated by foreign tax credits note this list excludes countries that allow visafree travel with valid us visas for example costa rica dominican republic mexico panama also note that the green card holder might already have visafree access to many destinations by virtue of the nationality already held

the typical variations over the months of the year due to wind availability solar power will be discussed in three distinct varieties electric energy is generated by two different methods thermal and photovoltaic application is either utility scale for electric grid power generation or much smaller distributed systems which may or may not be integrated into the electric grid utility grade systems have well documented generation but distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled therefore quantitative evaluation of distributive solar to the overall us electric power environment has been lacking recently the energy information administration has begun estimating that contribution in utility scale solar contributed g kwh billion kwh to the grid with g kwh from photovoltaics and g kwh from thermal systems in and eia estimated that distributed solar generated g kwh and g kwh respectively prior to in six southwestern states arizona california colorado nevada new mexico and utah the us bureau of land management owned nearly million acres an area larger than the state of montana that was open to proposals for solar power installations to streamline consideration of applications the blm produced a programmatic environmental impact statement peis by the subsequent record of decision in october the blm withdrew percent of its land from possible solar development leaving million acres still open to applications for solar installations an area nearly as large as south carolina of the area left open to solar proposals the blm has identified thousand acres in highly favorable areas it calls solar energy zones solar energy generating systems segs is the name given to nine solar power plants in the mojave desert segs ivii are

of solar electricity from such distributed pv systems state information follows the usa is the world leader in online capacity and the generation of electricity from geothermal energy according to state energy data geothermal energy provided approximately billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity of the electricity consumed in the us as of may geothermal electric power was generated in five us states alaska california hawaii nevada and utah according to the geothermal energy associations recent report there were new geothermal power projects underway in states as of may this is an increase of projects in an additional three states compared to a survey completed in november  the most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the energy policy act of this act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit previously available only to wind power projects it also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the department of energy and gave the bureau of land management new legal guidance and secure funding to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits installed geothermal capacity in megawatts mw by state as of february  the contribution over the last eleven years of geothermal power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the geothermal power generation for  the us department of energy stated in that more than million homes and businesses were currently using solar water heating in the united states representing a capacity of over megawatts mw of thermal energy generation it predicted that another mw was likely to be installed over the next years assuming that percent of existing homes in the united states have adequate access to sunlight million solar water heaters could be installed solar water heaters can operate in any climate performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site as well as how cold the water coming into the system is the colder the water the more efficiently the system operates solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about twothirds and pay for their installation within to years with electricity or natural gas savings compared to those with electric water heaters florida homeowners with solar water heaters save to percent on their water heating bills according to the florida solar energy center in biomass generated million megawatthours of total us generated electricity it was the largest source of total renewable energy in the us and the thirdlargest renewable source of electrical power in the us after hydropower and wind biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat the main advantage of using grown fuels as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal natural gas and oil is that while they are growing they absorb the nearequivalent in carbon dioxide an important greenhouse gas to that which is later released in their burning although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass several years or decades as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels with proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs electricity heatingcooling and transportation fuels however each usage is distinctly different from the others especially regarding efficiency the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source whereas pellets for heating can be up to efficient bioelectricity plants are comparable to coal power plants with around efficiency and biofuels from crops or algae even less biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories wood and wood derived fuels including woodwood waste solids including paper pellets railroad ties utility poles wood chiips bark and wood waste solids wood waste liquids red liquor sludge wood spent sulfite liquor and other wood based liquids and black liquor and other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste landfill gas sludge waste agricultural byproducts other biomass solids other biomass liquids and other biomass gases including digester gases methane and other biomass gases the contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for and this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs  most cars on the road today in the us can run on blends of up to ethanol and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends ford daimlerchrysler and gm are among the automobile companies that sell flexiblefuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to ethanol e by mid there were approximately six million ecompatible vehicles on us roads the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date flexfuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability the energy independence and security act of which calls for billion us gallons m of biofuels to be used annually by will also help to expand the market the expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction operations and maintenance mostly in rural communities according to the renewable fuels association the ethanol industry created almost us jobs in alone boosting household income by billion it also contributed about billion in tax revenues at the local state and federal levels on the other hand in the biofuel industry received million in federal government support wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east west coasts as well as hawaii it has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy its use todate has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such the power output is currently modest but major installations are planned to come online within the next few years there are numerous organizations within the academic federal and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners sandia has a total budget of billion while nrel has a budget of million both sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel have heavily funded solar research programs british petroleum was also heavily invested in solar research programs until when the company began scaling back its solar operations the company finally shut down its fortyyearold solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive the nrel solar program has a budget of around million and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic pv technology solar thermal energy and solar radiation the budget for sandias solar division is unknown however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratorys billion budget several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years the solar energy research center serc at university of north carolina unc has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology in researchers at massachusetts institute of technology mit developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining in february north carolinabased semprius inc a solar development company backed by german corporation siemens announced that they had developed the worlds most efficient solar panel the company claims that the prototype converts of the sunlight that hits it to electricity more than double the previous highend conversion rate wind energy research dates back several decades to the s when nasa developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds today both sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research sandias laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials aerodynamics and sensors the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production reducing their capital costs and making wind energy more cost effective overall the field laboratory for optimized wind energy flowe at caltech was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost size and environmental impact of wind energy production as the primary source of biofuels in north america many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production on the federal level the usda conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets the national renewable energy laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn basedethanol it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood grasses or nonedible parts of plants moreover some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than cornbased ethanol sandia national laboratories conducts inhouse cellulosic ethanol research and is also a member of the joint bioenergy institute jbei a research institute founded by the united states department of energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels over billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states both the national renewable energy laboratory and sandia national laboratories have departments dedicated to hydrogen research in his january state of the union address president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy stating that he will not walk away from the promise of clean energy obama called for a commitment by the defense department to purchase mw of renewable energy he also mentioned the longstanding interior department commitment to permit mw of renewable energy projects on public land in  the american recovery and reinvestment act of included more than billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs this policystimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in us history for renewable energy advanced transportation and energy conservation initiatives these new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs while the department of energy has come under criticism for providing loan guarantees to solyndra its sunshot initiative has funded successful companies such as energysage and zep solar in february the us department of energy doe launched its sunshot initiative a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by by reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy costcompetitive with other forms of electricity and get grid parity  wind powering america wpa is another doe initiative that seeks to increase the use of wind energy wpa collaborates with state and regional stakeholders including farmers ranchers native americans rural electric cooperatives consumerowned utilities and schoolscitation needed wpa has focused on states with strong potential for wind energy generation but with few operational projects wpa provides information about the challenges benefits and impacts of wind technology implementation the solar america initiative sai is a part of the federal advanced energy initiative to accelerate the development of advanced photovoltaic materials with the goal of making it costcompetitive with other forms of renewable electricity by  the doe solar energy technology program setp intended to achieve the goals of the sai through partnerships and strategic alliances by focusing primarily on four areas as part of former governor arnold schwarzeneggers million solar roofs program california set a goal to create megawatts of new solarproduced electricity by with funding of billion the california solar initiative offers cash incentives on solar pv systems of up to a watt these incentives combined with federal tax incentives can cover up to of the total cost of a solar panel system financial incentives to support renewable energy are available in some other us states environmental protection agency facilities in the united states use renewable energy for all or part of their supply at the following facilities the epa named the top partners in its green power partnership that are generating their own renewable energy onsite combined they generate more than million kilowatthours of renewable energy onsite each year enough to power more than average us homes a renewable portfolio standard refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity portfolio from renewable generation sources liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market the energy policy act of requires all public electric utilities to facilitate net metering this allows homes and businesses performing distributed generation to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid for intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a battery to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted feedin tariff which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally from us households received more than billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes installing solar panels buying hybrid and electric vehicles and other clean energy investments these tax expenditures went predominantly to higherincome americans the bottom three income quintiles received about of all credits while the top quintile received about the most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles where the top income quintile received about of all credits market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects the american council on renewable energy acore is a nonprofit organization with headquarters in washington dc it was founded in as a unifying forum for bringing renewable energy into the mainstream of americans economy and lifestyle in acore had over member organizations in acore published outlook on renewable energy in america a two volume report about the future of renewable energy in the united states it has been said that this report exposes a new reality for renewable energy in america the environmental and energy study institute eesi is a nonprofit organization which promotes environmentally sustainable societies founded in by a group of congressional members eesi seeks to be a catalyst that moves society away from environmentally damaging fossil fuels and toward a clean energy future eesi presents policy solutions that will result in decreased global warming and air pollution improvements in public health energy security and rural economic development opportunities increased use of renewable energy sources and improved energy efficiency an important part of the

this article concerns proposals to change the social security system in the united states social security is a social insurance program officially called oldage survivors and disability insurance oasdi in reference to its three components it is primarily funded through a dedicated payroll tax during total benefits of billion were paid out versus income taxes and interest of billion a billion annual surplus excluding interest of billion the program had a cash deficit of billion estimates of lost revenues due to the temporary payroll tax cuts of and were offset by transfers of other government funds into the program this was billion in an estimated million people paid into the program and million received benefits in roughly workers per beneficiary reform proposals continue to circulate with some urgency due to a longterm funding challenge faced by the program starting in and continuing thereafter program expenses were expected to exceed cash revenues due to the aging of the babyboom generation resulting in a lower ratio of paying workers to retirees expected continuing low birth rate compared to the babyboom period and increasing life expectancy further the government has borrowed and spent the accumulated surplus funds called the social security trust fund at the end of the trust fund was valued at trillion up billion from the trust fund consists of the accumulated surplus of program revenues less expenditures in other words trillion more social security payroll taxes have been collected than have been used to pay social security beneficiaries the program has more than fully funded itself the fund contains nonmarketable treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government the funds borrowed from the program are part of the total national debt of trillion as of april  program payouts exceeded cash program revenues ie revenue excluding interest in this shortfall is expected to continue indefinitely under current law due to interest the trust fund will continue increasing through the end of reaching a peak of approximately trillion social security has the legal authority to draw amounts from other government revenue sources besides the payroll tax to fully fund the program while the trust fund exists however payouts greater than payroll tax revenue and interest income over time will liquidate the trust fund by meaning that only the ongoing payroll tax collections thereafter will be available to fund the program there are certain key implications to understand under current law if no reforms are implemented former president george w bush called for a transition to a combination of a governmentfunded program and personal accounts individual accounts or private accounts through partial privatization of the systemcitation needed president barack obama strongly opposes privatization or raising the retirement age but supports raising the annual maximum amount of compensation that is subject to the social security payroll tax of compensation in and in to help fund the program in addition on february president obama issued an executive order mandating the creation of the bipartisan national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform which made ten specific recommendations to ensure the sustainability of social security federal reserve chairman ben bernanke said on october reform of our unsustainable entitlement programs should be a priority he added the imperative to undertake reform earlier rather than later is great the tax increases or benefit cuts required to maintain the system as it exists under current law are significantly higher the longer such changes are delayed for example raising the payroll tax rate to during from the current or cutting benefits by would address the programs budgetary concerns indefinitely these amounts increase to and respectively if no changes are made until during the congressional budget office reported on the financial effects of various reform options social security is funded through the federal insurance contributions act tax fica a payroll tax employers and employees are responsible for making equal fica contributions during social security taxes were levied on the first of income for employment amounts earned above that are not taxed covered workers are eligible for retirement and disability benefits if a covered worker dies his or her spouse and children may receive survivors benefits social security accounts are not the property of their beneficiary and are used solely to determine benefit levels social security funds are not invested on behalf of beneficiaries instead current receipts are used to pay current benefits the system known as payasyougo as is typical of some insurance and definedbenefit plans in each year since tax receipts and interest income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures in by more than billion however without further legislation or change in benefits this annual surplus will change to a deficit around when payments begin to exceed receipts and interest thereafter the fiscal pressures are due to demographic trends where the number of workers paying into the program continues declining relative to those receiving benefits payroll tax rates were cut during and as a stimulus measure these cuts expired at the end of the social security trustees estimated the amounts at billion total billion in and billion in transfers of other government funds made the program whole as if these tax cuts had not occurred the number of workers paying into the program was per retiree in this declined to in and is projected to decline to by furthermore life expectancy continues to increase meaning retirees collect benefits longer federal reserve chairman bernanke has indicated that the aging of the population is a longterm trend rather than a proverbial pig moving through the python the accumulated surpluses are invested in special nonmarketable treasury securities treasuries issued by the us government which are deposited in the social security trust fund at the end of the trust fund stood at trillion the trillion amount owed by the federal government to the social security trust fund is also a component of the us national debt which stood at trillion as of may by the government is expected to have borrowed nearly trillion against the social security trust fund projections were made by the board of trustees of the federal oldage and survivors insurance and federal disability insurance trust funds oasdi in their st annual report dated may expenses exceeded tax receipts in the trust fund is projected to continue to grow for several years thereafter because of interest income from loans made to the us treasury however the funds from loans made have been spent along with other revenues in the general funds in satisfying annual budgets at some point however absent any change in the law the social security administration will finance payment of benefits through the net redemption of the assets in the trust fund because those assets consist solely of us government securities their redemption will represent a call on the federal governments general fund which for decades has been borrowing the trust funds surplus and applying it to its expenses to partially satisfy budget deficits to finance such a projected call on the general fund some combination of increasing taxes cutting other government spending or programs selling government assets or borrowing would be required the balances in the trust fund are projected to be depleted either by oasdi trustees projection or by congressional budget offices extendedbaseline scenario assuming proper and continuous repayment of the outstanding treasury notes at that point under current law the systems benefits would have to be paid from the fica tax alone revenues from fica are projected at that point to be continue to cover about of projected social security benefits if no change is made to the current tax and benefit schedules increasing unemployment due to the subprime mortgage crisis of has significantly reduced the amount of payroll tax income that funds social security further the crisis also caused more to apply for both retirement and disability benefits than expected during payroll taxes and taxation of benefits resulted in cash revenues of billion while payments totaled billion resulting in a cash surplus excluding interest of billion interest of billion meant that the social security trust fund overall increased by billion ie the cash surplus plus interest the cash surplus of billion was a significant reduction from the billion cash surplus of  rising income inequality also affects the funding of the social security program the center for economic and policy research estimated in february that upward redistribution of income is responsible for about of the projected social security shortfall over the next years this is because income over the payroll tax cap in is not taxed if more income flows to those earning above this threshold the program funding is lower than it would otherwise be the social security administration explained in that historically an average of roughly of covered earnings have been subject to the payroll tax in this figure reached but it has declined since then as of about of covered earnings fall under the taxable maximum the cbo projected in that an increase in payroll taxes ranging from of the payroll tax base equivalent to of gdp would be necessary to put the social security program in fiscal balance for the next years in other words raising the payroll tax rate to about during from the current or cutting benefits by would address the programs budgetary concerns indefinitely these amounts increase to around and if no changes are made until the value of unfunded obligations under social security during fy was approximately trillion in other words this amount would have to be set aside today such that the principal and interest would cover the shortfall over the next years projections of social securitys solvency are sensitive to assumptions about rates of economic growth and demographic changes the center on budget and policy priorities wrote in the year social security shortfall is about the same size as the cost over that period of extending the and tax cuts for the richest percent of americans those with incomes above a year members of congress cannot simultaneously claim that the tax cuts for people at the top are affordable while the social security shortfall constitutes a dire fiscal threat because social security tax receipts and interest exceed payments the program also reduces the size of the annual federal budget deficit commonly reported in the media for example cbo reported that for fiscal year the onbudget deficit was billion social security and the post office are considered offbudget social security had an estimated surplus of billion by cbo accounting different from the billion reported by the trustees and the post office had a deficit of resulting in a total budget deficit of billion this latter figure is the one commonly reported in the media ideology plays a major part of framing the social security debate key points of philosophical debate include among others retirees and others who receive social security benefits have become an important bloc of voters in the united states indeed social security has been called the third rail of american politics meaning that any politician sparking fears about cuts in benefits by touching the program endangers his or her political career the new york times wrote in january that social security and medicare have proved almost sacrosanct in political terms even as they threaten to grow so large as to be unsustainable in the long run conservatives and libertarians argue that social security reduces individual ownership by redistributing wealth from workers to retirees and bypassing the free market social security taxes paid into the system cannot be passed to future generations as private accounts can thereby preventing the accumulation of wealth to some degree private accounts also have a much higher rate of return than social security accounts conservatives tend to argue for a fundamental change in the structure of the program conservatives also argue that the us constitution does not permit the congress to set up a savings plan for retirees leaving this authority to the states although the us supreme court ruled in helvering v davis that congress had this authority liberals argue that government has the obligation to provide social insurance through mandatory participation and broad program coverage during social security constituted more than half of the income of nearly twothirds of retired americans for one in six it is their only income liberals tend to defend the current program preferring tax increases and payment modifications the conservative position is often proprivatization there are countries other than the us that have set up individual accounts for individual workers which allow workers leeway in decisions about the securities in which their accounts are invested which pay workers after retirement through annuities funded by the individual accounts and which allow the funds to be inherited by the workers heirs such systems are referred to as privatized currently the united kingdom sweden and chile are the most frequently cited examples of privatized systems the experiences of these countries are being debated as part of the current social security controversy in the united states in the late s privatization found advocates who complained that us workers paying compulsory payroll taxes into social security were missing out on the high rates of return of the us stock market the dow averaged compounded annually for the th century they likened their proposed private retirement accounts pras to the popular individual retirement accounts iras and k savings plans but in the meantime several conservative and libertarian organizations that considered it a crucial issue such as the heritage foundation and cato institute continued to lobby for some form of social security privatization the liberal position is typically antiprivatization those who have taken an antiprivatization position argue several points among others including advocates of major change in the system generally argue that drastic action is necessary because social security is facing a crisis in his state of the union speech president bush indicated that social security was facing bankruptcy in his state of the union speech he described entitlement reform including social security as a national challenge that if not addressed timely would present future congresses with impossible choices staggering tax increases immense deficits or deep cuts in every category of spending a liberal think tank the center for economic and policy research says that social security is more financially sound today than it has been throughout most of its year history and that bushs statement should have no credibility in nobel laureate economist paul krugman deriding what he called the hype about a social security crisis wrote president ronald reagan stated in october social security has nothing to do with the deficitsocial security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on employer and employee if you reduce the outgo of social security that money would not go into the general fund to reduce the deficit it would go into the social security trust fund so social security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit the claims of the probability of future difficulty with the current social security system are largely based on the annual analysis made of the system and its prospects and reported by the governors of the social security system while such analysis can never be accurate it can at least be made using different probable future scenarios and be based on rational assumptions and reach rational conclusions with the conclusions being no better in terms of predicting the future than the assumptions on which the predictions are based with these predictions in hand it is possible to make at least some prediction of what the future retirement security of americans who will rely on social security might be it is worth noting that james roosevelt former associate commissioner for retirement policy for the social security administration claims that the crisis is more a myth than a fact the social security public trustees including charles blahous warned in may that the window for effective action to take place was rapidly closing with less favorable options available to rectify the problems as time passes proponents of the current system argue if and when the trust fund runs out there will still be the choice of raising taxes or cutting benefits or both advocates of the current system say that the projected deficits in social security are identical to the prescription drug benefit enacted in they say that demographic and revenue projections might turn out to be too pessimisticand that the current health of the economy exceeds the assumptions used by the social security administration these social security proponents argue that the correct plan is to fix medicare which is the largest underfunded entitlement repeal the tax cuts and balance the budget they believe a growth trendline will emerge from these steps and the government can alter the social security mix of taxes benefits benefit adjustments and retirement age to avoid future deficits the age at which one begins to receive social security benefits has been raised several times since the programs inception robert l clark an economist at north carolina state university who specializes in aging issues formerly served as a chairman of a national panel on social securitys financial status he has said that future options for social security are clear you either raise taxes or you cut benefits there are lots of ways to do both david koitz a year veteran of the congressional research service echoed these remarks in his book seeking middle ground on social security reform the real choices for resolving the systems problemsrequire current lawmakers to raise revenue or cut spendingto change the law now to explicitly raise future taxes or constrain future benefits he discusses the social security amendments that followed the greenspan commissions recommendations it was the commissions recommendations that provided political cover for both political parties to act the changes approved by president reagan in were phased in over time and included raising the retirement age from to taxation of benefits cost of living adjustment cola delays and inclusion of new federal hires in the program there was a key point during the debate when house members were forced to choose between raising the retirement age or raising future taxes they chose the former senator daniel patrick moynihan indicated the compromises involved showed that lawmakers could still govern koitz cautions against the concept of a free lunch retirement security cannot be provided without benefit cuts or tax increases economist alice m rivlin summarized major reform proposals in january fixing social security is a relatively easy technical problem it will take some combination of several muchdiscussed marginal changes raising the retirement age gradually in the future and then indexing it to longevity raising the cap on the payroll tax fixing the cost of living adjustment and modifying the indexing of initial benefits so they grow more slowly for more affluent people in view of the collapse of market values no one is likely to argue seriously for diverting existing revenues to private accounts so the opportunity to craft a compromise is much greater than it was a few years ago fixing social security would be a confidence building achievement for bipartisan cooperation and would enhance our reputation for fiscal prudence various institutions have analyzed different reform alternatives including the cbo us news world report the aarp and the urban institute the cbo reported in july the effects of a series of policy options on the actuarial balance shortfall which over the year horizon is approximately of gdp social security is facing a longrun shortfall of approximately gdp per year or billionyear in dollars key reform proposals include one way to measure mandatory program risks is in terms of unfunded liabilities the amount that would have to be set aside today such that principal and interest would cover program shortfalls spending over tax revenue dedicated to the program these are measured over a year period and infinite horizon by the programs trustees cbo estimated in january that raising the full retirement age for social security from to would reduce outlays by about raising the early retirement age from to has little impact as those who wait longer to begin receiving benefits get a higher amount raising the retirement age increases the size of the workforce and the size of the economy by about  cbo provided estimates regarding various reform alternatives in a july letter to senator orrin hatch for example cbo wrote to bring the oasdi social security program as a whole into actuarial balance through with the taxable maximum set according to current law in the combined oasdi payroll tax rate could be permanently increased by about percentage pointsunder that option the combined oasdi payroll tax rate would rise from percent to percent in revenues credited to the social security trust funds in would increase by about percent this would raise taxes for a worker earning by about per year the aarp publishes its views on social security reform options periodically it summarized its views on a series of reform options during october  the urban institute estimated the effects of alternative solutions during may along with an estimated program deficit reduction on february president obama issued an executive order mandating the creation of the bipartisan national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform which had the goal to ensure lasting social security solvency prevent the projected cuts to come in reduce elderly poverty and distribute the burden fairly the cochairmen of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform published their final report in december the cochairmen estimated the effects of alternative solutions along with an estimated program deficit reduction in addition the final report proposed the steps to ensure the sustainability of social security such as as of september barack obama indicated preliminary views on social security reform his website indicated that he will work with members of congress from both parties to strengthen social security and prevent privatization while protecting middleclass families from tax increases or benefit cuts as part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years he would ask families making over to contribute a bit more to social security to keep it sound he has opposed raising the retirement age privatization or cutting benefits the current system sets the initial benefit level based on the retirees past wages the benefit level is based on the highest years of earnings this initial amount is then subject to an annual cost of living adjustment or cola recent cola were in in and zero for  the cola is computed based on the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers or cpiw according to the cbo many analysts believe that the cpiw overstates increases in the cost of living because it does not fully account for the fact that consumers generally adjust their spending patterns as some prices change relative to others however cbo also reported that cpie an experimental version of the cpi that reflects the purchasing patterns of older people has been percentage points higher than the cpiw over the past three decades cbo estimates that reducing the cola by annually from its current computed amount would reduce the year actuarial shortfall by of gdp or about reducing each years cola results in an annual compounding effect with greater effect on those receiving benefits the longest there is disagreement about whether a reduction in the cola constitutes a benefit cut the center for budget and policy priorities considers any reduction in future promised benefits to be a cut however others dispute this assertion because under any indexing strategy the actual or nominal amount of social security checks would never decrease but could increase at a lesser rate cbo estimated in that raising the retirement age to gradually would eliminate half the year funding shortfall however raising the retirement age disproportionally impacts lowerincome workers and those who perform manual labor the social security full payout retirement age in was years of age it is gradually rising to however most americans begin taking reduced early benefits at age while americans are living longer much of the increase in life expectancy is among those with higher incomes the social security administration estimated that retirees who made aboveaverage incomes in their working years live six years longer than they did in the s however retirees in the bottom half of the income distribution live only years longer in addition many lowerincome workers have jobs that require standing or manual labor which becomes increasingly difficult for older workers progressive indexing would lower the cola or benefit levels for higher wage groups with no impact or lesser impact on lowerwage groups the congressional research service reported that progressive indexing would index initial benefits for low earners to wage growth as under current law index initial benefits for high earners to price growth resulting in lower projected benefits compared to currentlaw promised benefits and index benefits for middle earners to a combination of wage growth and price growth president bush endorsed a version of this approach suggested by financier robert pozen which would mix price and wage indexing in setting the initial benefit level the progressive feature is that the less generous price indexing would be used in greater proportion for retirees with higher incomes the san francisco chronicle gave this explanation under pozens plan which is likely to be significantly altered even if the concept remains in legislation all workers who earn more than about a year would receive some benefit cuts for example those who retire in years while earning about a year would see their benefits reduced by percent from the benefits promised under the current plan those who earn the maximum income in for payroll taxes and retire in would see their benefits cut percent as under the current system all retirees would have their initial benefit amount adjusted periodically for price inflation occurring after their retirement thus the purchasing power of the monthly benefit level would be frozen rather than increasing by the difference between the typically higher cpiw and typically lower cpiu a broader measure of inflation during payroll taxes were levied on the first of income earnings above that amount were not taxed approximately of workers earned over this amount in because of this limit people with higher incomes pay a lower percentage of tax than people with lower incomes the payroll tax is therefore a regressive tax cbo estimated in that removing the cap on the payroll tax ie making all income subject to the flat payroll tax rate would fully fund the program for years removing the cap on income over only ie a donut in the tax code would address about of the program shortfall over years in march senator tom harkin introduced s strengthening social security act of supporters of the bill state that by making millionaires and billionaires pay the same rate of social security taxes as the rest of us and by changing the method by which social security benefits are calculated sen harkins bill would expand social security benefits by an average of per recipient per year while also keeping the program solvent for generations supporters include the alliance for retired americans the letter of support by the alliance a nonprofit nonpartisan organization of million states that s recognizes the true importance of this great american program and proposes measures that would both enhance benefits for current beneficiaries and strengthen the longterm solvency of social security for all americans peter a diamond and peter r orszag proposed in their book saving social security a balanced approach that social security be stabilized by various tax and spend adjustments and gradually ending the process by which the general fund has been borrowing from payroll taxes this requires increased revenues devoted to social security their plan as with several other social security stabilization plans relies on gradually increasing the retirement age raising the ceiling on which people must pay fica taxes and slowly increasing the fica tax rate to a peak of total from the current  according to a june pew research center poll however the poll also indicated americans are skeptical about the future of the program among the overall public just expect that social security will have sufficient resources to provide the current level of benefits say there will be enough money to provide reduced benefits and think that when they retire the program will be unable to provide any benefits according to a december pew research center poll a january pew research center poll indicated that making social security system sound was the th highest priority of out topics according to a july gallup poll many americans doubt they will get social security benefits although the level of doubt is similar to readings going back to over of americans say they doubt the system will be able to pay them a benefit when they retire the percentage has fluctuated since its initial reading at in and has peaked at has high as in the percentage is for those aged but is above for those this view runs contrary to the social security trustees reports which indicate that since payroll taxes are dedicated to the program by law even without reform social security will pay about of promised benefits after the trust fund is exhausted in the early s critics argue that privatizing social security does nothing to address the longterm funding concerns diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees requiring significant borrowing an analysis by the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that president bushs privatization proposal would add trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and trillion in the decade thereafter the economic report of the president found that the federal budget deficit would be more than percent of gross domestic product gdp higher every year for roughly two decades us gdp in was trillion the debt burden for every man woman and child would be higher after years because of privatization privatization proponents counter that the savings to the government would come through a mechanism called a clawback where profits from private account investment would be taxed or a benefit reduction meaning that individuals whose accounts underperformed the market would receive less than current benefit schedules although even in this instance the heirs of those who die early could receive increased benefits even if the accounts underperformed historical returns opponents of privatization also point out that even conceding for sake of argument that what they call highly optimistic numbers are true they fail to count what the transition will cost the country as a whole gary thayer chief economist for a g edwards has been cited in the mainstream media saying that the cost of privatizingestimated by some at trillion to trillionwould worsen the federal budget deficit in the short term and thats not something i think the credit markets would appreciate if as in some plans the interest expenditure on this debt is recaptured from the private accounts before any gains are available to the workers then the net benefit could be small or nonexistent and this is really a key to understanding the debate because if on the other hand a system which mandated investment of all assets in us treasuries resulted in a positive net recapturing this would illustrate that the captive nature of the system results in benefits that are lower than if it merely allowed investment in us treasuries purported to be the safest investment on earth current social security system advocates claim that when the risks overhead costs and borrowing costs of any privatization plan are taken together the result is that such a plan has a lower expected rate of return than pay as you go systems they point out the high overheads of privatized plans in the united kingdom and chile even some of those who oppose privatization agree that if current future promises to the current young generation are kept in the future they will experience a much lower rate of return than past retirees have under privatization each workers benefit would be the combination of a minimum guaranteed benefit and the return on the private account the proponents argument is that projected returns higher than those individuals currently receive from social security and ownership of the private accounts would allow lower spending on the guaranteed benefit but possibly without any net loss of income to beneficiaries both wholesale and partial privatization pose questions such as how much added risk will workers bear compared to the risks they face under current system what are the potential rewards and what happens at retirement to workers whose privatized risks turn out badly for workers privatization would mean smaller social security checks in addition to increased compensation from returns on investments according to historical precedent debate has ensued over the advisability of subjecting workers retirement money to market risks a technical economic argument for privatization is that without it the payroll taxes that support social security constitute a tax wedge that reduces the supply of labor like other tax financed government welfare programs liberal economists like peter orszag and joseph stiglitz have argued that social security is already perceived as enough of a forced savings program to preclude a reduction in the labor supply richard disney has agreed with this reply noting to the extent that pension contributions are perceived as giving individuals rights to future pensions the behavioral reaction of program participants to contributions will differ from their reactions to other taxes in fact they might regard pension contributions as providing an opportunity for retirement saving in which case contributions should not be deducted by economists from households earnings and should not be included in the tax wedge privatization advocates nonetheless do not believe that social security taxes will be sufficiently regarded as pension contributions as long as they remain legally structured as taxes as opposed to being contributions to their own private pensions to the extent that pension contributions are perceived as giving individuals rights to future pensions the behavioral reaction of program participants to contributions will differ from their reactions to other taxes in fact they might regard pension contributions as providing an opportunity for retirement saving in which case contributions should not be deducted from households earnings and should not be included in the tax wedge supporters of the current system maintain that its combination of low risks and low management costs along with its social insurance provisions work well for what the system was designed to provide a baseline income for citizens derived from savings from their perspective the major deficiency of any privatization scheme is risk like any private investments pras could fail to produce any return or could produce a lower return than proponents of privatization assert and could even suffer a reduction in principal advocates of privatization have long criticized social security for lower returns than the returns available from other investments and cite numbers based on historical performance the heritage foundation a conservative think tank calculates that a yearold male with an income just under will contribute in payroll taxes to the social security trust fund over his working life and can expect to receive per month in return under the current program they claim that the same yearold male investing the same equally weighted into treasuries and highgrade corporate bonds over his working life would own a pra at retirement worth which would pay an annuity of up to per month assuming that the dollar volume of such investments would not dilute yields so that they are lower than averages from a period in which no such dilution occurredclarification needed furthermore they argue that the efficiency of the system should be measured not by costs as a percent of assets but by returns after expenses eg a return reduced by expenses would be preferable to a return reduced by expenses other advocates state that because privatization would increase the wealth of social security users it would contribute to consumer spending which in turn would cause economic growth supporters of the current system argue that the longterm trend of us securities markets cannot safely be extrapolated forward because stock prices relative to earnings are already at very high levels by historical standardscitation needed they add that an exclusive focus on longterm trends would ignore the increased risks they think privatization would cause the general upward trend has been punctuated by severe downturns critics of privatization point out that workers attempting to retire during any future such downturns even if they prove to be temporary will be placed at a severe disadvantage proponents argue that a privatized system would open up new funds for investment in the economy and would produce real growth they claim that the treasuries held in the current trust fund are covering consumption rather than investments and that their value rests solely upon the continued ability of the us government to impose taxes michael kinsley has said that there would be no net new funds for investment because any money diverted into private accounts would produce a dollarfordollar increase in the federal governments borrowing from other sources to cover its general deficit meanwhile some investmentminded observers among those who do not support privatization point out potential pitfalls to the trust funds undiversified portfolio containing only treasuries many of these support the government itself investing the trust fund into other securities to help boost the systems overall soundness through diversification in a plan similar to calpers in the state of california among the proponents of this idea were some members of president bill clintons social security commission that studied the issue the majority of the group supported partial privatization and other members put forth the idea that social security funds should themselves be invested in the private markets to gain a higher rate of return another criticism of privatization is that while it might theoretically relieve the government of financial responsibility in practice for every winner from moving risk from the collective to the individual there will be a loser and the government will be held politically responsible for preventing those losers from slipping into poverty proponents of the current system suspect that for the individuals whose risks turn out badly these same individuals will support political action to raise state benefits such that the risks such individuals may be willing to take under a privatized system are not without moral hazard there are also substantive issues that do not involve economics but rather the role of government conservative nobel prizewinning economist gary s becker currently a graduate professor at the university of chicago wrote in a february article that privatization reduces the role of government in determining retirement ages and incomes and improves government accounting of revenues and spending obligations he compares the privatization of social security to the privatization of the steel industry citing similar excellent reasons opponents of privatization also decry the increased management costs that any privatized system will incur dishonest schemes can be sold to naive buyers in which pension values are bled through fees and commissions such as happened in the uk in  since the us system is passively managedwith no specific funds being tied to specific investments within individual accounts and with the systems surpluses being automatically invested only in treasuriesits management costs are very low advocates of privatization at the cato institute a libertarian think tank counter that based on existing private pension plans it appears reasonable to assume that the costs of administering a wellrun system of pras might be anywhere from a low of roughly basis points to a high of roughly basis points they also point to the low costs of index funds funds whose value rises or falls according to a particular financial index including an sp index fund whose management fees run between basis point and basis points  opponents also claim that privatization will bring a windfall for wall street brokerages and mutual fund companies who will rake in billions of dollars in management fees austan goolsbee at the university of chicago has written a study the fees of private accounts and the impact of social security privatization on financial managers which calculates that under plan ii of the presidents commission to strengthen social security csss the net present value npv of such payments would be billion and amounts to about onequarter of the npv of the revenue of the entire financial sector for the next years and concludes that the fees would be the largest windfall gain in american financial history other analysts argue that dangers of a wall street windfall of such magnitude are being vastly overstated rob mills vicepresident of the brokerage industry trade group securities industry association calculated in a report published in december that the proposed private accounts might generate billion in fees in npv terms over the next years this amount would represent only of the sectors projected npv revenues of trillion over that timeframe he concludes that privatization is hardly likely to be a bonanza for wall street a range of other proposals have been suggested for partial privatization such as the solution one suggested by a number of republican candidates during the elections would set aside an initially small but increasing percentage of each workers payroll tax into a fund which the worker would be allowed to invest in securities another eliminated the social security payroll tax completely for workers born after a certain date and allowed workers of different ages different periods of time during which they could opt to not pay the payroll tax in exchange for a proportional delay in their receipt of payouts most state pension plans invest a portion of employer and employee contributions in a mixture of stocks bonds real estate etc which they or professional fund managers invest on behalf of the employees without creating individual investment accounts president george w bush discussed the partial privatization of social security since the beginning of his presidency in but only after winning reelection in did he begin to invest his political capital in pursuing changes in earnest in may he announced establishment of a member bipartisan commission to study and report specific recommendations to preserve social security for seniors while building wealth for younger americans with the specific directive that it consider only how to incorporate individually controlled voluntary personal retirement accounts the majority of members serving on bill clintons similar social security commission in had recommended through their own report that partial privatization be implemented bushs commission to strengthen social security csss issued a report in december revised in march which proposed three alternative plans for partial privatization on february bush made social security a prominent theme of his state of the union address in this speech which sparked the debate it was plan ii of cssss report that bush outlined as the starting point for changes in social security he outlined in general terms a proposal based on partial privatization after a phasein period workers currently less than years old would have the option to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in individual accounts that could be invested in the private sector in a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds workers making such a choice might receive larger or smaller benefits than if they had not done socitation needed depending on the performance of the investments they selected although bush described the social security system as headed for bankruptcy his proposal would not affect the projected shortfall in social security tax receipts partial privatization would mean that some workers would pay less into the systems general fund and receive less back from it administration officials said that the proposal would have a net neutral effect on the systems financial situation and that bush would discuss with congress how to fill the projected shortfall the congressional budget office had previously analyzed the commissions plan ii the plan most similar to bushs proposal and had concluded that the individual accounts would have little or no overall effect on the systems solvency and that virtually all the savings would come instead from changing the benefits formula as illustrated by the cbo analysis one possible approach to the shortfall would be benefit cuts that would affect all retirees not just those choosing the private accounts bush alluded to this option mentioning some suggestions that he linked to various former democratic officeholders he did not endorse any specific benefit cuts himself however he said only all these ideas are on the table he expressed his opposition to any increase in social security taxes later that month his press secretary scott mcclellan ambiguously characterized raising or eliminating the cap on income subject to the tax as a tax increase that bush would oppose in his speech bush did not address the issue of how the system would continue to provide benefits for current and nearfuture retirees if some of the incoming social security tax receipts were to be diverted into private accounts a few days later however vicepresident dick cheney stated that the plan would require borrowing billion over the period to that estimate has been criticized as being unrealistically low on april bush held a televised press conference at which he provided additional detail about the proposal he favored for the first time he endorsed reducing the benefits that some retirees would receive he endorsed a plan from robert pozen described below in the section regarding suggestions for social security that do not involve privatization although bushs state of the union speech left many important aspects of his proposal unspecified debate began on the basis of the broad outline he had given the political heat was turned up on the issue since bush mentioned changing social security during the elections and since he made it clear in his nationally televised january speech that he intended to work to partially privatize the system during his second term to assist the effort republican donors were asked after the election to help raise million or more for a campaign in support of the proposal with contributions expected from such sources as the fiscally conservative c organization club for growth and the securities industry in a cato institute paper had noted that privatization would require mobilizing the various coalitions that stand to benefit from the changethe business community and financial institutions in particular soon after bushs state of the union speech the club for growth began running television advertisements in the districts of republican members of congress whom it identified as undecided on the issue a group backed by labor unions called americans united to protect social security set its sights on killing bushs privatization plan and silencing his warnings that social security was headed toward bankruptcycitation needed on january the new york times reported internal social security administration documents directing employees to disseminate the message that social securitys longterm financing problems are serious and need to be addressed soon and to insert solvency messages in all social security publications coming soon after the disclosure of government payments to commentator armstrong williams to promote the no child left behind act the revelation prompted the objection from dana c duggins a vice president of the social security council of the american federation of government employees that trust fund dollars should not be used to promote a political agenda in the weeks following his state of the union speech bush devoted considerable time and energy to campaigning for privatization he held town meetings at many locations around the country attendance at these meetings was controlled to ensure that the crowds would be supportive of bushs plan in denver for example three people who had obtained tickets through representative bob beauprez a republican were nevertheless ejected from the meeting before bush appeared because they had arrived at the event in a car with a bumper sticker reading no more blood for oil opponents of bushs plan have analogized his dire predictions about social security to similar statements that he made to muster support for the invasion of iraq a dispute between the aarp and a conservative group for older americans usa next cropped up around the time of the state of the union speech the aarp had supported bushs plan for major changes in medicare in but it opposed his social security privatization initiative in january before the state of the union address the aarp ran advertisements attacking the idea in response usa next launched a campaign against aarp charlie jarvis of usa next stated they aarp are the boulder in the middle of the highway to personal savings accounts we will be the dynamite that removes them the tone of the debate between these two interest groups is merely one example among many of the tone of many of the debates discussions columns advertisements articles letters and white papers that bushs proposal to touch the third rail has sparked among politicians pundits thinktankers and taxpayers immediately after bushs state of the union speech a national poll brought some good news for each side of the controversy only of the respondents thought the social security system was in a state of crisis but thought it had major problems the general idea of allowing private investments was favored by and opposed by specific proposals that received more support than opposition in each case by about a twotoone ratio were limiting benefits for wealthy retirees and requiring higher income workers to pay social security taxes on all of their wages the poll was conducted by usa today cnn and the gallup organization bushs april press conference detailed the proposal further with bush describing his preference in a reform system should protect those who depend on social security the most and describing his proposal as a social security system in the future where benefits for lowincome workers will grow faster than benefits for people who are better off opponents countered that middleclass retirees would experience cuts and that those below the poverty line would receive only what they are entitled to under current law democrats also expressed concern that a social security system that primarily benefited the poor would have less widespread political support finally the issue of private accounts continued to be a divisive one many legislators remained opposed or dubious while bush in his press conference said he felt strongly about the point despite bushs emphasis on the issue many republicans in congress were not enthusiastic about his proposal and democrats were unanimously opposed in late may house majority whip roy blunt listed the priority legislation to be acted on after memorial day social security was not included and bushs proposal was considered by many to be dead in september some congressional republicans pointed to the budgetary problems caused by hurricane katrina as a further obstacle to acting on the bush proposal congress did not enact any major changes to social security in or before its preelection adjournment in  during the campaigning for the midterm election bush stated that reviving his proposal for privatizing social security would be one of his top two priorities for his last two years in office in he continued to pursue that goal by nominating andrew biggs a privatization advocate and former researcher for the cato institute to be deputy commissioner of the social security administration when the senate did not confirm biggs bush made a recess appointment enabling biggs to hold the post without senate confirmation until december during his last days in office bush said that spurring the debate on social security was his most effective achievement during his presidency some allege that george w bush is opposed to social security on ideological grounds regarding it as a form of governmental redistribution of income which other groups such as libertarians strongly oppose some of the critics of bushs plan argued that its real purpose was not to save the current social security system but to lay the groundwork for dismantling it they note that in when bush was asked about a possible transition to a fully privatized system he replied its going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehiclethis is a step toward a completely different world and an important step his comment is consonantcitation needed with the cato institutes reference in to a leninist strategy for guerrilla warfare against both the current social security system and the coalition that supports it critics of the system such as nobel laureate economist milton friedman have said that social security redistributes wealth from the poor to the wealthy workers must pay including a employer contribution on their wages below the social security wage base in but no tax on income in excess of this amount therefore high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income resulting in a regressive tax the benefit paid to each worker is also calculated using the wage base on which the tax was paid changing the system to tax all earnings without increasing the benefit wage base would result in the system being a progressive tax furthermore wealthier individuals generally have higher life expectancies and thus may expect to receive larger benefits for a longer period than poorer taxpayers often minorities a single individual who dies before age who is more likely to be poor receives no retirement benefits despite years of paying social security tax on the other hand an individual who lives to age who is more likely to be wealthy is guaranteed payments that are more than he or she paid into the system a factor working against wealthier individuals and in favor of the poor with little other retirement income is that social security benefits become subject to federal income tax based on income the portion varies with income level at rising to at for married couples in this does not just affect those that continue to work after retirement unearned income withdrawn from tax deferred retirement accounts like iras and ks counts towards taxation of benefits still other critics focus on the quality of life issues associated with social security claiming that while the system has provided for retiree pensions their quality of life is much lower than it would be if the system were required to pay a fair rate of return the party leadership on both sides of the aisle have chosen not to frame the debate in this manner presumably because of the unpleasantness involved in arguing that current retirees would have a much higher quality of life if social security legislation mandated returns that were merely similar to the interest rate the us government pays on its borrowings it has been argued that the first generation of social security participants have in effect received a large gift because they received far more benefits than they paid into the system robert j shiller noted that the initial designers of the social security system in had envisioned the building of a large trust fund but the amendments and subsequent changes prevented this from happening as such the gift to the first generation is necessarily borne by subsequent generations in this payasyougo system current workers are paying the benefits of the previous generation instead of investing for their own retirement and therefore attempts at privatizing social security could result in workers having to pay twice once to fund the benefits of current retirees and a second time to fund their own retirement critics have noted that the funding mechanism of an illegal ponzi scheme where early investors are paid off out of the funds collected from later investors instead of out of profits from business activity has similarities with social securitys payasyougo funding mechanism in particular a sustainability problem when there is a declining number of new paying entrants william g shipman of the cato institute argues in common usage a trust fund is an estate of money and securities held in trust for its beneficiaries the social security trust fund is quite different it is an accounting of the difference between tax and benefit flows when taxes exceed benefits the federal government lends itself the excess in return for an interestpaying bond an iou that it issues to itself the government then spends its new funds on unrelated projects such as bridge repairs defense or food stamps the funds are not invested for the benefit of present or future retirees this criticism is not new in his presidential campaign republican alf landon called the trust fund a cruel hoax the republican platform that year stated the socalled reserve fund estimated at fortyseven billion dollars for old age insurance is no reserve at all because the fund will contain nothing but the governments promise to pay while the taxes collected in the guise of premiums will be wasted by the government in reckless and extravagant political schemes the social security administration responds to the criticism as follows there is a superficial analogy between pyramid or ponzi schemes and payasyougo insurance programs in that in both money from later participants goes to pay the benefits of earlier participants but that is where the similarity ends a payasyougo system can be visualized as a simple pipeline with money from current contributors coming in the front end and money to current beneficiaries paid out the back end as long as the amount of money coming in the front end of the pipe maintains a rough balance with the money paid out the system can continue forever there is no unsustainable progression driving the mechanism of a payasyougo pension system and so it is not a pyramid or ponzi scheme if the demographics of the population were stable then a payasyougo system would not have demographicallydriven financing ups and downs and no thoughtful person would be tempted to compare it to a ponzi arrangement however since population demographics tend to rise and fall the balance in payasyougo systems tends to rise and fall as well this vulnerability to demographic ups and downs is one of the problems with payasyougo financing but this problem has nothing to do with ponzi schemes or any other fraudulent form of financing it is simply the nature of payasyougo systems 
following the bursting of the housing bubble in mid the united states entered a severe recession the united states entered during a housing market correction and a subprime mortgage crisis the national bureau of economic research nber dates the beginning of the recession as december according to the department of labor roughly million jobs were shed from february to february and gdp contracted by making the great recession the worst since the great depression unemployment rose from in november to peak at in october of  the bottom or trough was reached in the second quarter of marking the technical end of the recession defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining gdp the nber dating by month points to june as the final month of the recession the recovery after the trough was weak and both gdp and job growth erratic and uneven a solid strong pace of job growth was not seen until as of august the unemployment rate is below the historical average of but still barely above the when the recession started in december with roughly jobs added since the great recessions payroll trough in february american household net worth fell from a prerecession peak of trillion in q to trillion by q while real median household income fell from in to by the poverty rate increased from to reaching a peak of and held there through before dropping to in  after the great depression of the s the american economy experienced robust growth with periodic lesser recessions for the rest of the th century the federal government enforced the securities exchange act and the chandler act which tightly regulated the financial markets the securities exchange act of regulated the trading of the secondary securities market and the chandler act regulated the transactions in the banking sector there were a few investment banks small by current standards that expanded during the late s such as jp morgan the reagan administration in the early s began a thirtyyear period of financial deregulation the financial sector sharply expanded in part because investment banks were going public bringing them vast sums of stockholder capital from to the average salary for workers outside of investment banking in the us increased from k to k a percent salary increase while the average salary in investment banking increased from k to k a percent salary increase deregulation also precipitated financial fraud often tied to real estate investments sometimes on a grand scale such as the savings and loan crisis by the end of the s many workers in the financial sector were being jailed for fraud but many americans were losing their life savings large investment banks began merging and developing financial conglomerates this led to the formation of the giant investment banks like goldman sachs in the early months of many observers believed that a us recession had begun the collapse of bear stearns and the resulting financial market turbulence signaled that the crisis would not be mild and brief alan greenspan exchairman of the federal reserve stated in march that the financial crisis in the united states is likely to be judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of world war ii a chief economist at standard poors said in march he had projected a worstcasescenario in which the country would endure a doubledip recession in which the economy would briefly recover in the summer before plunging againcitation needed under this scenario the economys total output as measured by the gross domestic product gdp would drop by percentage points making it among the worst recessions in the post world war ii periodcitation needed the former head of the national bureau of economic research said in march that he believed the country was then in a recession and it could be a severe onecitation needed a number of private economists generally predicted a mild recession ending in the summer of when the economic stimulus checks going to million households started being spent a chief economist at moodys predicted in march that policymakers would act in a concerted and aggressive way to stabilize the financial markets and that then the economy would suffer but not enter a prolonged and severe recessioncitation needed it takes many months before the national bureau of economic research the unofficial arbiter of when recessions begin and end makes its own ruling according to numbers published by the bureau of economic analysis in may the gdp growth of the previous two quarters was positive as one common definition of a recession is negative economic growth for at least two consecutive fiscal quarters some analysts suggested this indicates that the us economy was not in a recession at the time however this estimate has been disputed by analysts who argue that if inflation is taken into account the gdp growth was negative for those two quarters making it a technical recession in a may report the chief north american economist for investment bank merrill lynch wrote that despite the gdp growth reported for the first quarter of it is still reasonable to believe that the recession started some time between september and january on the grounds that the national bureau of economic researchs four recession indicators all peaked during that period new yorks budget director concluded the state of new york was officially in a recession by the summer of governor david paterson called an emergency economic session of the state legislature for august to push a budget cut of million on top of a hiring freeze and a percent reduction in spending at state agencies that had already been implemented by the governor an august report issued by economists with wachovia bank said florida was officially in a recession white house budget director jim nussle maintained at that time that the us had avoided a recession following revised gdp numbers from the commerce department showing a percent contraction in the fourth quarter of down from a percent increase and a downward revision to percent from percent in the first quarter of the gdp for the second quarter was placed at a percent expansion below an expected percent on the other hand martin feldstein who headed the national bureau of economic research and served on the groups recessiondating panel said he believed the us was in a very long recession and that there was nothing the federal reserve could do to change it in a cnbc interview at the end of july alan greenspan said he believed the us was not yet in a recession but that it could enter one due to a global economic slowdown a study released by moodys found twothirds of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states were in a recession the study also said states were in recession with at risk the findings were based on unemployment figures and industrial production data in march financier warren buffett stated in a cnbc interview that by a common sense definition the us economy was already in a recession buffett has also stated that the definition of recession is flawed and that it should be three consecutive quarters of gdp growth that is less than population growth however the us only experienced two consecutive quarters of gdp growth less than population growth with the advent of internet trading of stocks and the development of new concepts in derivatives trading the investment banking sector flourished but often at the price of the loss both of transparency and of basic regulatory controls financial conglomerates investment banks and insurance firms were linked together in the trade of mortgage derivatives and other instruments in a system sometimes called the securitization food chain the securitization food chain created a method of mortgage transfer within the economy it consists of five positions in sequential order in the chain  in this sequence the home buyer grants to the lender a mortgage that the lender then passes to the investment banks for earning interest the investment banks bundle mortgages and similar debt instruments together into complex derivatives called collateralized debt obligations cdos the cdos are a mix of such things as home loans car loans student loans and credit card loans the credit rating agencies such as moodys and standard poors then indirectly rated these cdos while being paid by the investment banks for their rating service the cdos were sold to still other investors by the banks again based on the premise that they would earn interest the insurance agencies such as aig were selling a type of cdo known as credit default swaps to the investors and earning premiums the credit default swaps were presented as a kind of insurance for the investors if the rating of the cdo went down then the insurer was to pay the investors for their losses additionally with the introduction of derivatives the speculators were also betting against the cdos they didnt own the insurance companies were earning both through premium from investors as well as from the derivatives sold to the speculators thus the risk was transferred to the insurance agencies as the investments were risk free for the investors as the risk were borne by the insurance agencies in exchange for the premium the demand for the cdos grew investment banks sought more mortgages to form more cdos to continue the food chain in this climate lenders started signing riskier loans at their end of the food chain in the traditional mortgage system the borrower typically had to pay down percent of their desired investment the remaining percent could be borrowed from a lender moreover the consumer could take loans worth no more than about four times his or her annual salary the rise of the securitization food chain paved the way for more loosely termed loans as banks engaged in riskier lending the housing bubble nearly tripled the prices of homes and other realestate from to this huge increase was due in part to the uncontrolled credit given by the american banks that engaged in such practices and which further increased demand in the housing sector on december the caseshiller home price index reported the largest price drop in its history increased foreclosure rates in among us homeowners led to a crisis in august for the sub prime collateralized debt obligation mortgage credit hedge fund and foreign bank markets as early as october the us secretary of the treasury had called the bursting housing bubble the most significant risk to our only economy some analystswho believe federal government policies were responsible to a large extent for the recession in the united states and the resultant vast unemployment factors include the number of people not on temporary layoff surged in august and the level continues to reach new highs now at million this accounts for of the unemployed again a record high and this is a proxy for permanent job loss in other words these jobs are not coming back against that backdrop the number of people who have been looking for a job for at least six months with no success rose a further halfpercent in august to stand at million the longterm unemployed now represent a record of the total pool of joblessnesscitation needed alan greenspan was the chairman of the federal reserve of the united states from to he was appointed by president ronald reagan in august and was reappointed by president bill clinton in he was perhaps the person most singly responsible for the housing bubble in the us although he said that i really didnt get it until very late in and greenspan stated that the housing bubble was fundamentally engendered by the decline in real longterm interest rates though he also claims that longterm interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because the market value of global longterm securities is approaching trillion and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they now swamp the resources of central banks a book by hedrick smith who stole the american dream suggests that the powell memo was instrumental in setting a new political direction for us business leaders that led to americas contemporary economic malaise there was a sharp increase in subprime loans in now the borrowers could borrow even percent of their investments the investment banks preferred subprime loans as they earned high revenue due to high risk poorer ratings yield higher interest rates this massive credit flow drove demand in the housing sector helping expand the bubble mortgage regulations were relaxed and there were huge profits in the financial sector some stock prices tied to real estate and financial firms skyrocketed the leverage ratio during the bubble also was very high as banks borrowed heavily to give loans the leverage ratio is the ratio between the funds borrowed by banks and the banks own assets the ratio was nearly during late there were also faulty ratings by the trusted rating agencies due to the nature of the cdo and the passing of responsibility and risk up the securitization food chain however rating agencies had few if any liabilities if their ratings were wrongcitation needed on december the national bureau of economic research nber declared that the united states entered a recession in december citing employment and production figures as well as the third quarter decline in gdp the dow jones industrial average lost points that same day on january nobel prizewinning economist paul krugman wrote this looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second great depression on september the united states department of labor issued a report that its unemployment rate rose to the highest in five years and the congressional budget office forecast that the unemployment rate could reach as high as during the news report cited department of labor reports and interviewed jared bernstein an economist the unemployment rate jumped to percent in august its highest level in five years as the erosion of the job market accelerated over the summer employers cut jobs last month more than economists had expected and the labor department said that more jobs were lost in june and july than previously thought so far jobs have disappeared since january the unemployment rate which rose from percent in july is now at its highest level since september jared bernstein economist at the economics policy institute in washington said eight months of consecutive job losses had historically signaled that the economy was in a recession if anyone is still scratching their head over that one they can stop mr bernstein said stocks fell after the release of the report with the dow jones industrials down about points after about minutes of tradingnew york times cnn also reported the news quoted another economist and placed the news in context as of december the u unemployment figure was while u unemployment was on january a day dubbed bloody monday by the media jobs were lost in the us the unemployment rate among workers with college degrees rose to during the first quarter of this pinch was also spreading worldwide for all of the united states incurred a net loss of million jobs and for a net loss of million jobs unemployment rose from in december to peak at in october  from late through september before the official october bailout there was a series of smaller bank rescues that occurred which totalled almost billion in the summer of countrywide financial drew down a billion line of credit and then secured an additional billion bailout in september this may be considered the start of the crisis in middecember washington mutual bank cut more than jobs and closed its subprime mortgage business in midmarch bear stearns was bailed out by a gift of billion nonrecourse treasury bill debt assets in early july depositors at the los angeles offices of indymac bank frantically lined up in the street to withdraw their money on july indymac a spinoff of countrywide was seized by federal regulators and called for a billion bailout as the mortgage lender succumbed to the pressures of tighter credit tumbling home prices and rising foreclosures that day the financial markets plunged as investors tried to gauge whether the government would attempt to save mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac the two were placed into conservatorship on september  during the weekend of september lehman brothers declared bankruptcy after failing to find a buyer bank of america agreed to purchase investment bank merrill lynch the insurance giant aig sought a bridge loan from the federal reserve and a consortium of banks created an emergency fund of at least billion to deal with the effects of lehmans closure similar to the consortium put forth by financial titan jp morgan during the stock market panic of and the crash of citation needed stocks on wall street tumbled on monday september on september news emerged that the federal reserve might give aig an billion rescue package on september this was confirmed the terms of the package were that the federal reserve would receive an public stake in the firm the biggest bank failure in history occurred on september when jp morgan chase agreed to purchase the banking assets of washington mutual the year as of september had seen public corporations file for bankruptcy in the united states already higher than the for all of the largest corporate bankruptcy in us history also made a record year in terms of assets with lehmans size billion in assets alone surpassing all past annual totals the year also saw the ninth biggest bankruptcy with the failure of indymac bank the wall street journal stated that venture capital funding slowed down which in the past had led to unemployment and slowed new job creation the federal reserve took steps to feed economic expansion by lowering the prime rate repeatedly during  on september federal reserve chairman ben bernanke advised secretary of the treasury henry paulson that a large amount of public money would be needed to stabilize the financial system short selling on financial stocks was banned on september companies were also forced to disclose large short positions the treasury secretary also indicated that money funds would create an insurance pool to cover themselves against losses and that the government would buy mortgagebacked securities from banks and investment houses initial estimates of the cost of the treasury bailout proposed by the bush administrations draft legislation as of september were in the range of billion to trillion us dollars president george w bush asked congress on september for the authority to spend as much as billion to purchase troubled mortgage assets and contain the financial crisis the crisis continued when the united states house of representatives rejected the bill and the dow jones took a point plunge a revised version of the bill was later passed by congress but the stock market continued to fall nevertheless the first half of the bailout money was primarily used to buy preferred stock in banks instead of troubled mortgage assets this flew in the face of some economists argument that buying preferred stock would be far less effective than buying common stock as of midnovember it was estimated that the new loans purchases and liabilities of the federal reserve the treasury and fdic brought on by the financial crisis totalled over trillion trillion in loans by the fed to brokerdealers through the emergency discount window trillion in loans by the fed through the term auction facility billion to be raised by the treasury for the troubled assets relief program billion insurance for the gses by the treasury and trillion insurance for unsecured bank debt by fdic some portion of the feds emergency loans would already have been repaid the federal reserve treasury and securities and exchange commission took several steps on september to intervene in the crisis to stop the potential run on money market mutual funds the treasury also announced on september a new billion program to insure the investments similar to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic program part of the announcements included temporary exceptions to section a and b regulation w allowing financial groups to more easily share funds within their group the exceptions would expire on january unless extended by the federal reserve board the securities and exchange commission announced termination of shortselling of financial stocks as well as action against naked short selling as part of its reaction to the mortgage crisis the recession officially ended in the second quarter of but the nations economy continued to be described as in an economic malaise during the second quarter of and has been described as the weakest recovery since the great depression and world war ii the weak economic recovery has led many to call it a zombie economy socalled because it is neither dead nor alive household incomes as of august had fallen more since the end of the recession than during the month recession falling an additional since the end of the recession totally to since the december level additionally as of september the longterm unemployment is the highest it has been since world war ii and the unemployment rate peaked several months after the end of the recession in october and was above until september the federal reserve has kept interest rates at a historically low since december and both heads ben bernanke and janet yellen have stated that rates should remain low through at least mid as long as the recovery is still slow and inflation remains below  in the us gained million jobs million in million in and million in and in gdp grew roughly in in in in and in may also marked the recovery of all jobs lost during the recession over million jobs have been created since job losses stopped in february as of june however these new jobs are not equal in pay to those mediumpaying jobs lost roughly are highpaying jobs and are lowpaying jobs further widening the income gap between poor and affluent americans government attempts to reduce deficits via the sequester budget cuts will remain a drag on the economy for as long as the budget control act of remains in place economic indicators began an upward turn in with home values surging income jumping from to and more high and midpaying jobs created than lowwage jobs forecasts for are generally optimistic with gdp growth predicted to be around foreclosures falling to pre levels million jobs created and unemployment falling to or below which would make the best showing for the american economy since in september the census bureau reported that poverty had fallen from in to in mainly due to the recovering job market healthcare costs in the united states slowed in the period after the great recession a decrease in inflation and in the number of hospital stays per population drove a reduction in the rate of growth in aggregate hospital costs at this time growth slowed most for surgical stays and least for maternal and neonatal stays 
in the united states habitual offender laws commonly referred to as threestrikes laws are statutes enacted by state governments which mandate courts to impose harsher sentences on those convicted of an offense if they have been previously convicted of two prior serious criminal offenses they are designed to incapacitate those more likely to commit crime twentyfour states have some form of threestrikes law a person accused under such laws is referred to in a few states notably connecticut and kansas as a persistent offender while missouri uses the unique term prior and persistent offender in most jurisdictions only crimes at the felony level qualify as serious offenses however misdemeanor offenses can qualify for application of the threestrikes law in california whose application has been the subject of controversy the popular name of these laws threestrikes laws comes from baseball where a batter is permitted two strikes before striking out on the third the threestrikes law significantly increases the prison sentences of persons convicted of a felony who have been previously convicted of two or more violent crimes or serious felonies and limits the ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life sentence the practice of imposing longer prison sentences on repeat offenders versus firsttime offenders who commit the same crime is nothing new as judges often take into consideration prior offenses when sentencing however there is a more recent history of mandatory prison sentences for repeat offenders for example new york state had a longstanding persistent felony offender law dating back to the early th century partially ruled unconstitutional in but reaffirmed en banc shortly after but such sentences were not compulsory in each case and judges had much more discretion as to what term of incarceration should be imposed the first true threestrikes law was passed in when washington state voters approved initiative california passed its own in when their voters passed proposition by an overwhelming majority with in favor and against the initiative proposed to the voters had the title of three strikes and youre out referring to de facto life imprisonment after being convicted of three violent or serious felonies which are listed under california penal code section  the concept swiftly spread to other states but none of them chose to adopt a law as sweeping as californias by twentysix states and the federal government had laws that satisfy the general criteria for designation as threestrikes statutes namely that a third felony conviction brings a sentence of to life where years must be served before becoming parole eligible after the hype leading to the institution of these laws across the country it soon became apparent that they were not bringing the results the public expected data shows that the laws didnt necessarily reduce violent crime but instead in states such as california where a strike did not have to be a violent felony put away more criminals for nonviolent and petty crimes dramatically raising the prison population this led to the drastic reduction of the power of the threestrikes law in california in by approval of proposition  the following states have enacted threestrikes laws the exact application of the threestrikes laws varies considerably from state to state but the laws call for life sentences without possibility of release for at least years on their third strike most states require one or more of the three felony convictions to be for violent crimes in order for the mandatory sentence to be pronounced crimes that fall under the category of violent include murder kidnapping sexual abuse rape aggravated robbery and aggravated assault some states include additional lesser offenses that one would not normally see as violent california mandated a minimum sentence of tolife so long as the first two felonies were deemed to be either serious or violent for example california did not require the third strike to be serious or violent to qualify for a life sentence and strike felons could easily be given this enhanced sentence for minor third strike lawbreaking in addition the list of crimes that count as serious or violent in the state of california is much longer than that of other states and consists of many lesser offenses that include firearm violations burglary simple robbery arson and providing hard drugs to a minor and drug possession as another example texas does not require any of the three felony convictions to be violent but specifically excludes certain state jail felonies from being counted for enhancement purposes in sioux city iowa native tommy lee farmer a professional criminal who had served years in prison for murder and armed robbery was the first person in the united states to be convicted under the threestrikes law when he was sentenced to life in prison for his botched attempt to hold up an eastern iowa convenience store the sentencing was considered so significant that president bill clinton interrupted a vacation to make a press statement about it another example of the threestrikes law involves timothy l tyler who in at age was sentenced to life in prison without parole when his third conviction a federal offense triggered the federal threestrikes law notwithstanding that his two prior convictions involved drugs and neither conviction resulted in any prison time served the judge could not consider tylers drug addiction lack of violent conduct mental health issues or youth when sentencing violent crime but especially homicide has fallen in the los angeles area as well as other areas of southern california los angeless homicide count was less than a third of the high of homicides this statistic reflects overall national trends of decreasing violent crime and may be unrelated to the threestrikes law several studies have shown that the legislation was unlikely to have been the cause of lower crime rates an example was a study in which prethree strikes crime rate were compared to postthree strikes crime rate the dropping crime rate in california was compared directly to how severely counties enforced the three strikes law the dropping crime rate was the same in counties with both light and harsh enforcement sometimes being even greater in counties with lighter enforcement of the three strikes law a more recent study in analyzed the effect of the legislation as a means of deterrence and incapacitation showed that the three strikes law had no significant effect on deterrence of crime the ineffectiveness of the three strikes law on the crime rate may be due to the diminishing marginal returns associated with having preexisting repeat offender laws in place the punishments for homicides are extremely harsh resulting in extremely long sentences life sentences without the possibility of parole or even the death penalty even for the first conviction overshadowing any deterrent effect of the threestrikes law in addition the three strikes law completely ignores juveniles which make up a large part of violent crimes in california furthermore there is some evidence that criminals on their last strike are more desperate to escape justice and therefore more likely to attack police this does not reveal whether or not the criminals in question were or were not more desperate and willing to kill prior to their last strike financially the threestrikes law has had a strong effect in california since the cost of keeping an inmate incarcerated averages around dollars a year the more often the full force of the three strikes law is implemented the higher the cost for the state which many of those opposed to the law claim could be used for other resources such as schools or even rehabilitation programs for inmates themselves does three strikes deter a nonparametric estimation was a study published by researchers at george mason university in virginia and said that arrest rates were to per cent lower for the group of offenders convicted of twostrike eligible offences compared to those convicted of onestrike eligible offences the authors concluded this indicated that the threestrikes policy was deterring recidivists from committing crimes a study written by robert parker director of the presley center for crime and justice studies at uc riverside states that violent crime began falling almost two years before californias threestrikes law was enacted in the study argues that the decrease in crime is linked to lower alcohol consumption and unemployment a study from the vera institute of justice in new york examined the effectiveness of incapacitation depriving criminals of the opportunity to offend under all forms of sentencing mandatory or otherwise the study estimated that if us incarceration rates were increased by per cent the crime rate would decrease by to per cent but also cautioned that analysts are nearly unanimous in their conclusion that continued growth in incarceration will prevent considerably fewer if any crimes than past increases did and will cost taxpayers substantially more to achieve a study released by the national bureau of economic research found that threestrikes laws like californias while discouraging criminals from doing things like smoking pot or shoplifting may push those who do commit crime to commit more violent offenses the studys author radha iyengar argues that this is because under such laws felons knowing they could face a long jail sentence for their next crime have little to lose by committing serious crimes rather than minor offenses a study found that threestrikes laws were associated with a increase in the risk of fatal assaults on law enforcement officers 
free trade is a policy followed by some international markets in which countries governments do not restrict imports from or exports to other countries free trade is exemplified by the european economic area and the north american free trade agreement which have established open markets most nations are today members of the world trade organization wto multilateral trade agreements however most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas taxes and nontariff barriers such as regulatory legislation free trade policies generally promote the following features two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through david ricardos theory of comparative advantage and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota an economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade currently the world bank believes that at most rates of can be allowed by developing nationscitation needed but hajoon chang believes higher levels may be justified because the productivity gap between developing and developed nations is much higher than the productivity gap which industrial countries faced a general feature is that the underdeveloped nations of today are not in the same position that the developed nations were in when they had a similar level of technology because they are weak players in a competitive system the developed nations have always been strong players although formerly at an overall lower level counterarguments to this point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries have far richer markets to which to export than was the case in the th century if the main defense for tariffs is to stimulate infant industries a tariff must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete for the tariff to be successful this theory known as import substitution industrialization is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations the chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good prior to the tariff the price of the good in the world market and hence in the domestic market is pworld the tariff increases the domestic price to ptariff the higher price causes domestic production to increase from qs to qs and causes domestic consumption to decline from qc to qc this has three main effects on societal welfare consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus green region becomes smaller producers are better off because the producer surplus yellow region is made larger the government also has additional tax revenue blue region however the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government the magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society an almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results from that countrys perspective the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff under similar analysis export tariffs import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions free trade creates winners and losers but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses according to mainstream economic theory the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to economic inefficiency through the process of trade diversion it is economically efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss this is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions such as the doha round the literature analysing the economics of free trade is extremely rich with extensive work having been done on the theoretical and empirical effects though it creates winners and losers the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society in a survey of american economists responders agree that the us should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade and disagree with the suggestion that the us should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries quoting harvard economics professor n gregory mankiw few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards in a survey of leading economists none disagreed with the notion that freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both winner and loser will increase with the winner gaining more than the loser but both gaining more than before in an absolute level the notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in th century imperial spain american jurist arthur nussbaum noted that spanish theologian francisco de vitoria was the first to set forth the notions though not the terms of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas vitoria made the case under principles of jus gentium however it was two early british economists adam smith and david ricardo who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically adam smith for example pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just mediterranean cultures such as egypt greece and rome but also of bengal east india and china the great prosperity of the netherlands after throwing off spanish imperial rule and pursuing a policy of free trade made the free trademercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries free trade policies have battled with mercantilist protectionist isolationist communist populist and other policies over the centuries trade in colonial america was regulated by the british mercantile system through the acts of trade and navigation until the s few colonists openly advocated for free trade in part because regulations were not strictly enforcednew england was famous for smugglingbut also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping according to historian oliver dickerson a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the american revolution the idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong wrote dickerson was not a part of the thinking of the revolutionary leaders free trade came to what would become the united states as a result of american revolutionary war when the british parliament issued the prohibitory act blockading colonial ports the continental congress responded by effectively declaring economic independence opening american ports to foreign trade on april according to historian john w tyler free trade had been forced on the americans like it or not the st us secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton advocated tariffs to help protect infant industries in his report on manufactures for the most part the jeffersonians strongly opposed it in the th century statesmen such as senator henry clay continued hamiltons themes within the whig party under the name american system the opposition democratic party contested several elections throughout the s s and s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry in britain free trade became a central principle practiced by the s under the treaty of nanking china opened five treaty ports to world trade in the first free trade agreement the cobdenchevalier treaty was put in place in between the united kingdom and france which led to successive agreements between other countries in europe in the us the democratic party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only while the whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries the economist henry charles carey became a leading proponent of the american system of economics this mercantilist american system was opposed by the democratic party of andrew jackson martin van buren james k polk franklin pierce and james buchanan the fledgling republican party led by abraham lincoln who called himself a henry clay tariff whig strongly opposed free trade and implemented a percent tariff during the civil warin part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort and to protect favored industries william mckinley later to become president of the united states stated the stance of the republican party which won every election for president from until except the two nonconsecutive terms of grover cleveland as thus under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave protection is but the law of nature the law of selfpreservation of selfdevelopment of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man it is said that protection is immoral why if protection builds up and elevates the us population of people the influence of those of people elevates the rest of the world we cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere well they say buy where you can buy the cheapest of course that applies to labor as to everything else let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that and it is the protection maxim buy where you can pay the easiest and that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards many classical liberals especially in th and early th century britain eg john stuart mill and in the united states for much of the th century eg cordell hull believed that free trade promoted peacecitation needed woodrow wilson included freetrade rhetoric in his fourteen points speech of  the program of the worlds peace therefore is our program and that program the only possible program all we see it is this   the removal so far as possible of all economic barriers and the establishment of equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance during the interwar period economic protectionism took hold in the united states particularly as a result of the smoothawley tariff act which prolonged and spread the great depression from trade liberalization began to take place through the reciprocal trade agreements act the british economist john maynard keynes grew up with a belief in free trade this underpinned his criticism of the treaty of versailles in for the damage it did to the interdependent european economy after a brief flirtation with protectionism in the early s he came again to favour free trade so long as it was combined with internationally coordinated domestic economic policies to promote high levels of employment and international economic institutions that meant that the interests of countries were not pitted against each other in these circumstances the wisdom of adam smith again applied he saidcitation needed in kicking away the ladder development economist hajoon chang reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth and notes that many of the nowindustrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history the united states and britain sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times britain abolished the corn laws which restricted import of grain in in response to domestic pressures and it reduced protectionism for manufactures in the mid th century when its technological advantage was at its height but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to by the united states maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately up until the s augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the th century the most consistent practitioners of free trade have been switzerland the netherlands and to a lesser degree belgium chang describes the exportoriented industrialization policies of the four asian tigers as far more sophisticated and finetuned than their historical equivalents some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world most developed nations maintain controversialcitation needed agricultural tariffs from to the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from to in the developing world average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately  since the end of world war ii in part due to industrial size and the onset of the cold war the united states has often been a proponent of reduced tariffbarriers and free trade the us helped establish the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and later the world trade organization wto although it had rejected an earlier version in the s international trade organization or itocitation needed since the s us governments have negotiated managedtrade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta in the s the dominican republiccentral america free trade agreement cafta in and a number of bilateral agreements such as with jordancitation needed in europe six countries formed the european coal and steel community ecsc in which became the european economic community eec in two core objectives of the eec were the development of a common market subsequently renamed the single market and establishing a customs union between its member states after expanding its membership the eec became the european union eu in the european union now the worlds largest single market has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world most countries in the world are members of the world trade organization which limits in certain ways but does not eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers most countries are also members of regional free trade areas that lower trade barriers among participating countries the eu and the us are negotiating a transatlantic trade and investment partnership led by the us twelve countries that have borders on the pacific ocean are currently in private negotiations around the transpacific partnership which is being touted by the negotiating countries as a free trade policy the enabling trade index measures the factors policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destination it is made up of four subindexes market access border administration transport and communications infrastructure and business environment the top countries and areas are the relative costs benefits and beneficiaries of free trade are debated by academics governments and interest groups arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category trade hurts the economy or the moral category the effects of trade might help the economy but have ill effects in other areas a general argument against free trade is that it is colonialism or imperialism in disguise the moral category is wide including concerns of destroying infant industries and undermining longrun economic development income inequality environmental degradation supporting child labor and sweatshops race to the bottom wage slavery accentuating poverty in poor countries harming national defense and forcing cultural change economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories sociopolitical arguments against free trade cite social and political effects that economic arguments do not capture such as political stability national security human rights and environmental protection free trade is often opposed by domestic industries that would have their profits and market share reduced by lower prices for imported goods for example if united states tariffs on imported sugar were reduced us sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits while us sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices the economic theory of david ricardo holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose since each of those few domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the lifting of tariffs more generally producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum exploitation of workers by capital for example karl marx wrote in the communist manifesto the bourgeoisie has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation nonetheless marx favored free trade solely because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution free trade is opposed by many antiglobalization groups based on their assertion that free trade agreements generally do not increase the economic freedom of the poor or the working class and frequently make them poorer where the foreign supplier allows de facto exploitation of labor domestic freelabor is unfairly forced to compete with the foreign exploited labor and thus the domestic working class would gradually be forced down to the level of helotry to this extent free trade is seen as an endrun around workers rights and laws that protect individual liberty it is important to distinguish between arguments against free trade theory and free trade agreements as applied some opponents of nafta see the agreement as being materially harmful to the common people but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of governmentmanaged trade rather than against free trade per se for example it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the us into mexico freely under nafta at prices well below production cost dumping because of its ruinous effects to mexican farmers of course such subsidies violate free trade theory so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade but rather its selective implementation research shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education the authors find that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security this is not to say that the latter types of calculations are not important in shaping individuals views of tradejust that they are not being manifest in the simple association between education and support for trade openness research suggests that attitudes towards free trade do not necessarily reflect individuals selfinterests it has long been argued that free trade is a form of colonialism or imperialism a position taken by various proponents of economic nationalism and the school of mercantilism in the th century these criticized british calls for free trade as cover for british empire notably in the works of american henry clay architect of the american system and by german american economist friedrich list more recently ecuadorian president rafael correa has denounced the sophistry of free trade in an introduction he wrote for a book titled the hidden face of free trade accords written in part by correas current energy minister alberto acosta citing as his source the book kicking away the ladder written by hajoon chang correa identified the difference between an american system opposed to a british system of free trade the latter he says was explicitly viewed by the americans as part of the british imperialist system according to correa chang showed that it was treasury secretary alexander hamilton and not friedrich list who was the first to present a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism the following alternatives for free trade have been proposed balanced trade fair trade protectionism industrial policy the value of free trade was first observed and documented by adam smith in the wealth of nations in he wrote it is the maxim of every prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy if a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage this statement uses the concept of absolute advantage to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism the dominant view surrounding trade at the time which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports and thus amass wealth instead smith argues countries could gain from each producing exclusively the goods in which they are most suited to trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption in this vein it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important but the value of the goods produced by a nation the concept of absolute advantage however does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good this theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage generally attributed to david ricardo who expanded on it in his book on the principles of political economy and taxation it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good but on the relative opportunity costs of production a country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption this allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production while their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky  exceptionally henry georges book protection or free trade was read out loud in full into the congressional record by five democratic congressmen tyler cowen wrote that protection or free trade remains perhaps the bestargued tract on free trade to this day george discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor although george is very critical towards protectionism we all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals the building of railways the deepening of harbors the improvement of steamships as beneficial but if such things are beneficial how can tariffs be beneficial the effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities the effect of tariffs is to increase it if the protective theory be true every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased george considers the general free trade argument inadequate he argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never be sufficient to improve the situation of the working class unless accompanied by a shift towards land value

american exceptionalism is one of three related ideas the first is that the history of the united states is inherently different from other nations in this view american exceptionalism stems from its emergence from the american revolution thereby becoming what political scientist seymour martin lipset called the first new nation and developing a uniquely american ideology americanism based on liberty egalitarianism individualism republicanism democracy and laissezfaire for business this ideology itself is often referred to as american exceptionalism second is the idea that the us has a unique mission to transform the world as abraham lincoln put it in the gettysburg address americans have a duty to see that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth third is the sense that its history and its mission give the united states a superiority over other nations although the term does not necessarily imply superiority many neoconservative and other american conservative writers have promoted its use in that sense to them the us is like the biblical city upon a hilla phrase evoked by british colonists to north america as early as and exempt from historical forces that have affected other countries the theme of superiority is a common target for attacks from critics the theory of the exceptionalism of the us can be traced to alexis de tocqueville the first writer to describe the country as exceptional in and  the exact term american exceptionalism was occasionally used in the th century in his the yale book of quotations fred shapiro notes that exceptionalism was used to refer to the united states and its selfimage by the times of london on august its common use dates from communist usage the late s soviet leader joseph stalin chastised members of the jay lovestoneled faction of the american communist party for its claim that the us was independent of the marxist laws of history thanks to its natural resources industrial capacity and absence of rigid class distinctions stalin may have been told of the usage american exceptionalism by brouder zack in daily worker ny on the th of january before lovestones visit to moscow american communists started using the english term american exceptionalism in factional fights it then moved into general use among intellectuals in scottish political scientist richard rose noted that most american historians endorse exceptionalism he suggests that these historians reason as follows america marches to a different drummer its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons history size geography political institutions and culture explanations of the growth of government in europe are not expected to fit american experience and vice versa however postnationalist scholars have rejected american exceptionalism arguing that the us had not broken from european history and accordingly the us has retained classbased and racebased inequalities as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war in recent years scholars from numerous disciplines as well as politicians and commentators in the popular media have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept roberts and decuirci ask some historians support the concept of american exceptionalism but avoid the terminology and thereby avoid getting entangled in rhetorical debates bernard bailyn a leading colonial specialist at harvard although the concept of american exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas the term was first used in the s some claim that the phrase american exceptionalism originated with the american communist party in an english translation of a condemnation made in by soviet leader joseph stalin criticizing communist supporters of jay lovestone for the heretical belief that the us was independent of the marxist laws of history thanks to its natural resources industrial capacity and absence of rigid class distinctions this origin has been challenged however because the expression american exceptionalism was already used by brouder zack in the daily worker ny on the th of january before lovestones visit to moscow in addition fred shapiro editor of the yale book of quotations has noted that exceptionalism was used to refer to the united states and its selfimage during the civil war by the times on august  early examples of the terms usage do include a declaration made at the american communist convention proclaiming that the storm of the economic crisis in the united states blew down the house of cards of american exceptionalism after the s the phrase fell into obscurity for half a century until it was popularized by american newspapers in the s to describe americas cultural and political uniqueness the phrase became an issue of contention between presidential candidates barack obama and john mccain in the presidential campaign with republicans attacking obama for allegedly not believing in the concept the first reference to the concept by name and possibly its origin was by french writer alexis de tocqueville in his work democracy in america the position of the americans is therefore quite exceptional and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one their strictly puritanical origin their exclusively commercial habits even the country they inhabit which seems to divert their minds from the pursuit of science literature and the arts the proximity of europe which allows them to neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism a thousand special causes of which i have only been able to point out the most important have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the american upon purely practical objects his passions his wants his education and everything about him seem to unite in drawing the native of the united states earthward his religion alone bids him turn from time to time a transient and distracted glance to heaven let us cease then to view all democratic nations under the example of the american people kammen says many foreign visitors commented on american exceptionalism including karl marx francis lieber hermann eduard von holst james bryce h g wells g k chesterton and hilaire belloc they did so in complimentary terms the theme became common especially in textbooks from the s to the late th century the mcguffey readers sold million copies and were studied by most american students skrabec argues that the readers hailed american exceptionalism manifest destiny and america as gods country furthermore mcguffey saw america as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world in june jay lovestone a leader of the communist party in america and soon to be named general secretary described americas economic and social uniqueness he noted the increasing strength of american capitalism and the countrys tremendous reserve power a strength and power which he said prevented communist revolution in the soviet leader joseph stalin disagreeing that america was so resistant to revolution called lovestones ideas the heresy of american exceptionalismthe first time that the specific term american exceptionalism was used the great depression seemingly underscored stalins argument that american capitalism falls under the general laws of marxism in june during the national convention of the communist party usa in new york it was declared that the storm of the economic crisis in the united states blew down the house of cards of american exceptionalism and the whole system of opportunistic theories and illusions that had been built upon american capitalist prosperity american uniqueness as a nation has been proposed by many writers historian dorothy ross discusses three major currents in the emerging postwar thinking around american exceptionalism riding with the rest of the nation on the wave of postdepression prosperity academics in the us redefined american exceptionalism as befitting a nation that was to lead the world with the newer united states ready to serve the older european societies as an example of a country liberated and free from marxist and socialist destinies more recently socialists and other writers have tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the us within and outside its borders more recently the concept has been discussed in the context of the st century in a book coauthored by former american vice president dick cheney exceptional why the world needs a powerful america  scholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of american exceptionalism many scholars use a model of american exceptionalism developed by harvard political scientist louis hartz in the liberal tradition in america hartz argued that the american political tradition lacked the leftwingsocialist and rightwingaristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial america lacked any feudal traditions such as established churches landed estates and a hereditary nobility the liberal consensus school typified by david potter daniel boorstin and richard hofstadter followed hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in american history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding private property individual rights and representative government the national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its european counterparts parts of american exceptionalism can be traced to american puritan roots many puritans with arminian leanings embraced a middle ground between strict calvinist predestination and a less restricting theology of divine providence they believed god had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the earth one puritan leader john winthrop metaphorically expressed this idea as a city upon a hillthat the puritan community of new england should serve as a model community for the rest of the world this metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism the puritans deep moralistic values remained part of the national identity of the united states for centuries remaining influential to the present day in this vein max weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism in earlier texts maximiliano korstanje explores the american exceptionalism and its effects on the current means of productions this contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance for two main reasons the first and most important he relates capitalism to protestantism this is of course nothing new since max weber did it in the past however korstanje adds though weber was correct by confirming the connection of the reformation to capitalism the key role played by norse mythology was left behind in effect the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by weber did not come from luther alone it was rather enrooted in the core of norse culture secondly this impossibility to understand the future led to english speaking societies to construct a riskprone culture which resulted in what ulrich beck dubbed the risk society the criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of capitalism should be explained by the economy of saved peoples formulated by weber the ideas that created the american revolution were derived from a tradition of republicanism that had been repudiated by the british mainstream historian gordon wood has argued our beliefs in liberty equality constitutionalism and the wellbeing of ordinary people came out of the revolutionary era so too did our idea that we americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy wood notes that the term is presently muchmaligned although it is vigorously supported by others such as jon butler thomas paines common sense for the first time expressed the belief that america was not just an extension of europe but a new land a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the british mother country these sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the revolutionary concept of american exceptionalism and were closely tied to republicanism the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people not to a hereditary ruling class religious freedom characterized the american revolution in unique waysat a time when major nations had state religions republicanism led by thomas jefferson and james madison created modern constitutional republicanism with a limit on ecclesiastical powers historian thomas kidd argues with the onset of the revolutionary crisis a major conceptual shift convinced americans across the theological spectrum that god was raising up america for some special purpose kidd further argues that a new blend of christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue according to tucker and hendrickson jefferson believed america was the bearer of a new diplomacy founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man by means that escaped war and its corruptions jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional european emphasis on reason of state which could justify any action and the traditional priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people jefferson envisaged america becoming the worlds great empire of libertythat is the model for democracy and republicanism he identified his nation as a beacon to the world for he said on departing the presidency in america was trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world the only monument of human rights and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and selfgovernment from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence marilyn b young argues that after the end of the cold war in neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an american empire a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations particularly underdeveloped ones she argues that after the september th terrorist attacks the george w bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of america an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of american empire young says the iraq war exemplified american exceptionalism in conservative historians larry schweikart and dave dougherty argued that american exceptionalism was based upon four pillars common law virtue and morality based in protestant christianity freemarket capitalism and the sanctity of private property in a book entitled exceptional why the world needs a powerful america former us vice president dick cheney sets out and argues the case for american exceptionalism and concludes we are as lincoln said the last best hope of earth we are not just one more nation one more indistinguishable entity on the world stage we have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us as roosevelt kennedy and reagan did of the special role we play neither they nor we should ever forget that we are in fact exceptional proponents of american exceptionalism argue that the united states is exceptional in that it was founded on a set of republican ideals rather than on a common heritage ethnicity or ruling elite in the formulation of president abraham lincoln in his gettysburg address america is a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal in lincolns interpretation america is inextricably connected with liberty and equality and in world perspective the american mission is to ensure that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth historian t harry williams argues that lincoln believed american policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism between the states and the federal government and checks and balances among the legislative executive and judicial branches which were designed to prevent any faction region or government organ from becoming too powerful some proponents of the theory of american exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the united states from suffering a tyranny of the majority are preservative of a free republican democracy and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those citizens values a consequence of this political system is that laws can vary greatly across the country critics of american exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities on balance the american political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more national dominance than does a more unitary system historian eric foner has explored the question of birthright citizenship the provision of the fourteenth amendment that makes every baby born in the united states a full citizen he argues that yale law school dean harold hongju koh has identified what he says is the most important respect in which the united states has been genuinely exceptional with regard to international affairs international law and promotion of human rights namely in its exceptional global leadership and activism he argues to this day the united states remains the only superpower capable and at times willing to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build sustain and drive an international system committed to international law democracy and the promotion of human rights experience teaches that when the united states leads on human rights from nuremberg to kosovo other countries follow peggy noonan an american political pundit wrote in the wall street journal that america is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world it attempts to be a force for good because it is exceptional former us vice president dick cheney explores the concept of united states global leadership in a book on american foreign policy entitled exceptional why the world needs a powerful america coauthored with his daughter liz cheney a former official of the united states department of state proponents of american exceptionalism often claim that many features of the american spirit were shaped by the frontier process following frederick jackson turners frontier thesis they argue the american frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuriesold european institutions such as royalty standing armies established churches and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land however this frontier experience was not entirely unique to the united states other nations had frontiers but it did not shape them nearly as much as the american frontier did usually because it was under the control of a strong national government south africa russia brazil argentina canada and australia had long frontiers but they did not have free land and local control the political and cultural environments were much differentthe other frontiers did not involve widespread ownership of free land nor allow the settlers to control the local and provincial governments as in america their frontier did not shape their national psyches each nation had quite different frontier experiences for example the dutch boers in south africa were defeated in war by britain in australia mateship and working together was valued more than individualism was in the united states for most of its history especially from the midth to early th centuries the united states has been known as the land of opportunity and in this sense it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background examples of this social mobility include however social mobility in the us is lower than in a number of european union countries if defined in terms of income movements american men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar men in the nordic countries or the united kingdom many economists such as harvard economist n gregory mankiw however state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity rather it is a reflection of income disparity moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one regarding public welfare richard rose asked whether the evidence shows whether the us is becoming more like other mixedeconomy welfare states or increasingly exceptional he concludes by comparison with other advanced industrial nations america is today exceptional in total public expenditure in major program priorities and in the value of public benefits scholars have been polarized on the topic historians have generally weighed against it while empirical social scientists have been supporters michael kammen reports that historians lawrence veysey c vann woodward eric foner sean wilentz akira iriye and ian tyrrell have been opponents while support has come from social scientists daniel bell seymour martin lipset alex inkeles sanford jacoby samuel p huntington mona harrington john p roche richard rose peter temin and aaron wildavsky kammen argues that the hostile attacks began in the s in the wake of the vietnam war when many intellectuals decided the american adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless tarnished gulliver at about the same time the new social history used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with europe on issues such as social mobility by the s labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a labor party to emerge in the united states does not mean that america was exceptionally favorable grounds for workers by the late s other academic critics started mocking the excessive chauvinism displayed by popular usage of exceptionalism finally mids colonial historians downplayed the uniqueness of the american experience in the context of british history on the other hand some of the critics pulled their punches with wilentz arguing for distinctively american forms of class conflict and foner saying there was a distinctive character of american trade unionism the third idea of american exceptionalismsuperiorityhas been attacked with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards in american exceptionalism and human rights canadian commentator michael ignatieff couches his discussion of the topic in entirely pejorative terms he identifies three main subtypes exemptionalism supporting treaties as long as us citizens are exempt from them double standards criticizing others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies but ignoring what these bodies say of the united states and legal isolationism the tendency of us judges to ignore other jurisdictions during the george w bush administration the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the united states as being above or an exception to the law specifically the law of nations this phenomenon is less concerned with justifying american uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law this new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis and historical orientation diverge somewhat from older uses of the term a certain number of those who subscribe to oldstyle or traditional american exceptionalism the idea that america is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a special role to play in world historyalso agree that the united states is and ought to be fully subject to and bound by the public international law indeed recent research shows that there is some indication for american exceptionalism among the us public but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes on september in the context on us president barack obamas comment about american exceptionalism during his september talk to the american people while considering military action on syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians russian president vladimir putin criticized obama saying that it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional whatever the motivation in his interview with rt on october president of ecuador rafael correa criticized obamas policies and compared americas exceptionalism with nazi germany saying does not this remind you of the nazis rhetoric before and during world war ii they considered themselves the chosen race the superior race etc such words and ideas pose extreme danger critics on the left such as marilyn young and howard zinn have argued that american history is so morally flawed citing slavery civil rights and social welfare issues that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue zinn argues that american exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign especially when dealing with native americans donald e pease mocks american exceptionalism as a state fantasy and a myth in his book the new american exceptionalism pease notes that state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at abu ghraib prison and the exposure of government incompetence after hurricane katrina opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism american theologian reinhold niebuhr argued that the automatic assumption that america acts for the good will bring about moral corruption however niebuhr did support the nations cold war policies his position called christian realism advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations us historians like thomas bender try and put an end to the recent revival of american exceptionalism a defect he esteems to be inherited from the cold war gary w reichard and ted dickson argue how the development of the united states has always depended on its transactions with other nations for commodities cultural values and populations roger cohen asks how exceptional can you be when every major problem you face from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to gas prices requires joint action harold koh distinguishes distinctive rights different labels the flying buttress mentality and double standards the fourth facedouble standardspresents the most dangerous and destructive form of american exceptionalism godfrey hodgson also concludes that the us national myth is dangerous samantha power asserts that were neither the shining example nor even competent meddlers its going to take a generation or so to reclaim american exceptionalism in pope leo xiii denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of americanism in the encyclical testem benevolentiae nostrae he targeted american exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain arguing that it stood in opposition to papal denunciations of modernism at the end of the th century there was a tendency among catholic clergy in the united states to view american society as inherently different from other christian nations and to argue that the understanding of church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass the american experience which included greater individualism tolerance of other religions and churchstate separation herbert london has defined preemptive declinism as a postmodern belief that the united states is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations london ascribed the view to paul krugman among others krugman had written in the new york times that weve always known that americas reign as the worlds greatest nation would eventually end but most of us imagined that our downfall when it came would be something grand and tragic according to realclearpolitics declarations of americas declining power have been common in the englishlanguage media in flora lewis said that talk of us decline is real in the sense that the us can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills according to anthony lewis in europeans and asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the united states is in decline citing americas dependence on foreign sources for energy and crucial weaknesses in the military tom wicker concluded that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficultnearly impossiblefor the united states in pat buchanan lamented the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen in matthew parris of the sunday times in london wrote that the united states is overstretched romantically recalling the kennedy presidency when america had the best arguments and could use moral persuasion rather than force to have its way in the world from his vantage point in shanghai the international herald tribunes howard french worries about the declining moral influence of the united states over an emergent china in his book the postamerican world newsweek editor fareed zakaria refers to a postamerican world that he says is not about the decline of america but rather about the rise of everyone else in december historian peter baldwin published a book arguing that despite widespread attempts to contrast the american way of life and the european social model america and europe are actually very similar on a number of social and economic indices baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the us and europe such as homicide and child poverty the historian felipe fernndezarmesto argues that it is common thought that all people consider themselves exceptional in most cases in which this subject is broached the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences things such as the dynamic wealth creation the democracy the accessibility of opportunity the cult of civil liberty the tradition of tolerance and what fernndezarmesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy the excessive privileges of wealth and the selective illiberality are common features in many modern societies however he adds america is made exceptional by the intensity with which these characteristics are concentrated there in april barack obama responded to a journalists question in strasbourg with the statement i believe in american exceptionalism just as i suspect that the brits believe in british exceptionalism and the greeks believe in greek exceptionalism in the same response obama noted that i see no contradiction between believing that america has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent depends on our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we cant solve these problems alone mitt romney attacked obamas statement arguing it showed obama did not believe in american exceptionalism former arkansas governor mike huckabee said that obamas worldview is dramatically different from any president republican or democrat weve hadhe grew up more as a globalist than an american to deny american exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation in a speech on the syria crisis on september barack obama said but when with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run i believe we should actthats what makes america different thats what makes us exceptional in a direct response the next day russian president vladimir putin in an oped for the new york times on september articulated that it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional whatever the motivation he went on to say we are all different but when we ask for the lords blessings we must not forget that god created us equal 
school choice is a term or label given to a wide array of programs offering students and their families alternatives to publicly provided schools to which students are generally assigned by the location of their family residence in the united states the most commonboth by number of programs and by number of participating studentsschool choice programs are scholarship tax credit programs which allow individuals or corporations to receive tax credits toward their state taxes in exchange for donations made to nonprofit organizations that grant private school scholarships in other cases a similar subsidy may be provided by the state through a school voucher program other school choice options include open enrollment laws which allow students to attend public schools outside of the district in which the students live charter schools magnet schools virtual schools homeschooling education savings accounts esas and individual tax credits or deductions for educational expenses states with scholarship tax credit programs grant individuals andor businesses a credit whether full or partial toward their taxes for donations made to scholarship granting organizations also called school tuition organizations sgosstos use the donations to create scholarships that are then given to help pay for the cost of tuition for students these scholarships allow students to attend private schools or outofdistrict public schools that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive for many families these programs currently exist in fourteen states alabama arizona florida georgia illinois iowa kansas louisiana minnesota new hampshire oklahoma pennsylvania rhode island and virginia in the united states in a traditional public education system schools receive funding from the state on a per student basis under a voucher system eligible students receive state funding vouchers which can be spent at whatever eligible private schools the parents choose for their children the two most common voucher designs are universal vouchers and meanstested vouchers meanstested vouchers are directed towards lowincome families and constitute the bulk of voucher plans in the united states charter schools are independent public schools which are exempt from many of the state and local regulations which govern most public schools these exemptions grant charter schools some autonomy and flexibility with decisionmaking such as teacher union contracts hiring and curriculum in return charter schools are subject to stricter accountability on spending and academic performance the majority of states and the district of columbia have charter school laws though they vary in how charter schools are approved minnesota was the first state to have a charter school law and the first charter school in the united states city academy high school opened in st paul minnesota in   of dayton ohio children are in charter schools this is the highest percentage in the nation other hotbeds for charter schools are kansas city washington dc and arizona almost in public schools in arizona are charter schools comprising about of total enrollment charter schools can also come in the form of cyber charters cyber charter schools deliver the majority of their instruction over the internet instead of in a school building and like all charter schools cyber charters are public schools but they are free from some of the rules and regulations that conventional public schools must follow magnet schools are public schools that often have a specialized function like science technology or art these magnet schools unlike charter schools are not open to all children much like many private schools some but not all magnet schools require a test to get in home education or home schooling is instruction in a childs home or provided primarily by a parent or under direct parental control informal home education has always taken place and formal instruction in the home has at times also been very popular as public education grew in popularity during the s however the number of people educated at home using a planned curriculum dropped in the last years in contrast the number of children being formally educated at home has grown tremendously in particular in the united states the laws relevant to home education differ throughout the country in some states the parent simply needs to notify the state that the child will be educated at home in other states the parents are not free to educate at home unless at least one parent is a certified teacher and yearly progress reports are reviewed by the state such laws are not always enforced however according to the federal government about million children were home educated in  education savings accounts esas are somewhat similar to vouchers a percentage of the funds that the state would otherwise spend to educate a student in a public school are instead given to the students family to spend on private school tuition however esas give parents additional flexibility to customize their childrens educations for example in addition to private school tuition esa funds may be used for private tutoring or online learning alternatively esa funds may be saved to pay for future higher education costs currently there are esa programs in two states arizona empowerment savings accounts and florida the personal learning scholarship account program certain states allow parents to claim a tax credit or deduction as a means to provide relief for certain educational expenses these can include private school tuition textbooks school supplies and equipment tutoring and transportation currently alabama illinois indiana iowa louisiana minnesota and wisconsin have such programs the goal of school choice programs is to give parents more control over their childs education and to allow parents to pursue the most appropriate learning environments for children for example school choice may enable parents to choose a school that provides religious instruction stronger discipline better foundational skills including reading writing mathematics and science everyday skills from handling money to farming or other desirable foci supporters of voucher models of school choice argue that choice creates competition between schools for students schools that fail to attract students can be closed advocates of school choice argue that this competition for students and the dollars that come with them create a catalyst for schools to create innovative programs become more responsive to parental demands and to increase student achievement caroline hoxby suggests that this competition increases the productivity of a school hoxby describes a productive school as being one that produces high achievements in its student for each dollar that is spends others suggest that this competition gives parents more power to influence their childs school in the school marketplace parents and students become the consumers and schools must work to attract new students with new programs parents also have the ability to punish schools that they judge to be inferior by leaving the bad school for a better more highly ranked school parents look for schools that will advocate for the needs of their child and if the school does not meet the needs required for that child parents have the choice to find a school that will be more suitable another argument in favor of school choice is based on costeffectiveness studies undertaken by the cato institute and other libertarian and conservative thinktanks conclude that privately run education both costs less and produces superior outcomes compared to public education others argue that since children from impoverished families almost exclusively attend d or f ranked public schools school choice programs would give parents the power to opt their children out of poorlyperforming schools assigned by zip code and seek better education elsewhere supporters say this would level the playing field by broadening opportunities for lowincome studentsparticularly minoritiesto attend highquality schools that would otherwise be accessible only to higherincome families the organisation internationale pour le droit leducation et la libert denseignement oidel an international nonprofit organization for the development of freedom of education maintains that the right to education is a fundamental human right which cannot exist without the presence of state benefits and the protection of individual liberties according to the organization freedom of education notably implies the freedom for parents to choose a school for their children without discrimination on the basis of finances to advance freedom of education oidel promotes a greater parity between public and private schooling systems school choice measures are criticized as profiteering in an underregulated environment charter authorization organizations have nonprofit status and contract with related forprofit entities with public funding some reports indicate that the new markets tax credit allows double returns on charter school related investments reports indicate that charters create organizational arms that profit by charging high rent and that while the facilities are used as schools there are no property taxes other reports indicate bankers hedge fund types and private equity investors gathered in new york to hear about opportunities at capital roundtables conference on private equity investing in forprofit education companies which involve the collection of an individuals property taxes walton foundation has also held charter school investment conferences featuring standard poors piper jaffray bank of america and wells capital management public school entities are chiefly concerned that these school choice measures are taking funding away from public schools and therefore depleting their already strained resources other opponents of certain school choice policies particularly vouchers have cited the establishment clause and individual state blaine amendments which forbid to one degree or another the use of direct government aid to religiously affiliated entities this is of particular concern in the voucher debate because voucher dollars are often spent at parochial schools some school choice measures are criticized by public school entities organizations opposed to churchstate entanglement and selfidentified liberal advocacy groups known plaintiffs who have filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of state sponsored school choice laws are as follows school boards associations public school districts federations for teachers associations of school business officials education associationsassociations of educators unions for public school teachers the american civil liberties union freedom from religion foundation and people for the american way the basic compulsory educational system in finland is the nineyear comprehensive school finnish peruskoulu swedish grundskola basic school for which school attendance is mandatory homeschooling is allowed but extremely rare there are no socalled gifted programs the more able children are expected to help those who are slower to catch on the french government subsidizes most private primary and secondary schools including those affiliated with religious denominations under contracts stipulating that education must follow the same curriculum as public schools and that schools cannot discriminate on grounds of religion or force pupils to attend religion classes this system of cole libre free schooling is mostly used not for religious reasons but for practical reasons private schools may offer more services such as afterclass tutoring as well as the desire of parents living in disenfranchised areas to send their children away from the local schools where they perceive that the youth are too prone to delinquency or have too many difficulties keeping up with schooling requirements that the educational content is bound to suffer the threatened repealing of that status in the s triggered mass street demonstrations in favor of the statuscitation needed sweden reformed its school system in its system of school choice is one of the freest in the world allowing students to use public funds for the publicly or privately run school of their choice including religious and forprofit schools fifteen years after the reform private school enrolment had increased from to of the student population ontario is the only large province in canada with limited school choice funding catholic secular and one protestant school receive funding and are open to all students in following an international human rights ruling the provincial conservative government gradually introduced a tax credit over years when it would have been fully implemented it would have been worth up to of tuition to a maximum of at any independent school in ontario in order to meet the human rights norms and expand funded choice to all interested parents however the tax credit was retroactively canceled by the subsequent liberal government when it had been only been in place for two years to the point currently there are over independent schools in ontario the only school choice program available to nonrich parents who wish to send their children to an independent school is a privately funded program called children first a program of the fraser institute in chile there is an extensive voucher system in which the state pays private and municipal schools directly based on average attendance of the country students utilize such a system the result has been a steady increase in the number and recruitment of private schools that show consistently better results in standardized testing than municipal schools the reduction of students in municipal schools has gone from of all students in to in and to less than in  regarding vouchers in chile researchers have found that when controls for the students background parental income and education are introduced the difference in performance between public and private subsectors is not significant there is also greater variation within each subsector than between the two systems a variety of forms of school choice exist in the united states scholarship tax credit programs currently exist in alabama arizona florida georgia illinois iowa kansas louisiana minnesota new hampshire oklahoma pennsylvania rhode island and virginia arizona has a wellknown and fastgrowing tax

are indexed annually nearly children received scholarships in the school year since the program has started in over taxpayers have participated in the program providing over million in scholarship money for children at private schools across the state the arizona program was challenged in court in acsto v winn by a group of state taxpayers on the grounds that the tax credit violated the first amendment because the tuition grants could go to students who attend private schools with religious affiliations the suit was initially brought against the state until the arizona christian school tuition organization acsto one of the largest school tuition organizations in the state voluntarily stepped in to represent the defense with the help of the alliance defending freedom formerly alliance defense fund typically taxpayers are not allowed to bring suit against the government regarding how taxes are spent because injury would be purely speculative in addition insomuch as a donation to a school tuition organization is still a charitable act just like any donation to a charity there would be no standing unless all charitable deduction programs nationwide were brought under scrutiny the court ruled to let the tax credit program stand in april a fairleigh dickinson university publicmind poll found that a majority of american voters felt that the tax credits support school choice for parents whereas felt as it the tax credits support religion in iowa the educational opportunities act was signed into law in creating a pool of tax credits for eligible donors to

supreme court of the united states held that school vouchers could be used to pay for education in sectarian schools without violating the establishment clause of the first amendment as a result states are basically free to enact voucher programs that provide funding for any school of the parents choosingcitation needed the supreme court has not decided however whether states can provide vouchers for secular schools only excluding sectarian schools proponents of funding for parochial schools argue that such an exclusion would violate the free exercise clause however in locke v davey us the court held that states could exclude majors in devotional theology from an otherwise generally available college scholarship the court has not indicated however whether this holding extends to the public school context and it may well be limited to the context of individuals training to enter the ministrycitation needed the majority of states and the district of columbia have charter school
