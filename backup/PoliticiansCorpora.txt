buchanan once saying during an interview on the talk from the heart program with al kresta simulcast on kjsl st louis and wmuzfm detroit that buchanan had a black heart keyess entry into the republican race after buchanan had secured victories in new hampshire and louisiana led many to believe that keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the republican party since

in all cases except as an inadvertent result of efforts to save the mothers life said in a september news conference that jesus christ would not vote for obama because of votes that obamathen a member of the illinois senate judiciary committee and a lecturer in constitutional law at the university of chicago law schoolcast in against a package of three antiabortion bills that obama argued were too broad and unconstitutional the legislation which provided that a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person passed the republicancontrolled illinois senate but failed to pass out of the democraticcontrolled illinois house judiciary committee after the election keyes declined to congratulate obama explaining that his refusal to congratulate obama was not anything personal but was meant to make a statement against extending false congratulations to the triumph of what we have declared to be across the line of reasonable propriety he said that obamas position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line im supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward the triumph of that which i believe ultimately stands

me the question did so and if thats inappropriate blame the media do not blame me during the campaign keyes outlined an alternative to reparations for slavery his specific suggestion was that for a period of one or two generations africanamericans who were descended from slaves would be exempt from the federal income tax though not from the fica tax that supports social security keyes said the experiment would become a demonstration project for what i believe needs to be done for the whole country which is to get rid of the income tax he also called for the repeal of the th amendment in

justice roy moore citing both the us constitution and the alabama constitution as sanctioning moores and alabamas authority to publicly display the ten commandments in the states judicial building in defiance of a court order from us district judge myron thompson although the monument was ultimately removed by state authorities the issue impelled keyes to spend the next year advocating his understanding of the constitutions protection of the right of states to display monuments that reflect the religious sentiments of the people in their states as a result he published an essay describing his rationale titled on the establishment of religion what the constitution really says in early keyes sought to intervene in the terri schiavo case arguing that schiavos life was protected by the florida constitution and that governor jeb bush had final authority to determine the outcome of the case under state provisions he attempted to meet with bush to discuss the provisions of

criticized massachusetts governor mitt romney for instituting gay marriage entirely on his ownaccording to keyeswith no requirement or authority to do so under massachusetts law keyes said romneys actions which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and of the limitations of the judicial branch of government were not necessitated by a ruling of the massachusetts supreme judicial court in november that directed the state legislature to institute samesex marriage the massachusetts supreme judicial court had ruled that the state law banning samesex marriage was not constitutional the court gave the massachusetts legislature days to modify the law after it failed to do so gov mitt romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on may in compliance with the court ruling commenting on the issue keyes asked rhetorically since the legislature has not acted on the subject you might be wondering how it is that homosexuals are being married in massachusetts its because mitt romney who is telling people hes an opponent of samesex marriage forced the justices of the peace and others to perform samesex marriage all on his own with no authorization or requirement from the court tells you how twisted our politicians have become keyes olavo de carvalho author of a dozen books on philosophical and political matters and alejandro

be fingerprinted by the maine state police and to have background checks conducted on them the program purported to protect children from abuse by potential predators working within the schools but met with strong resistance from teachers unions which considered it a breach of civil liberties the laws supporters claimed the fingerprinting requirement would stop previous offenders from coming to maine to work in the schools and that if maine did not have this requirement it would send a message to previous offenders that they could work in maine without fear of being identified as child abusers the laws critics maintained that there was no evidence of a problem with child abuse by school employees and the fingerprinting represented a violation of constitutional guarantees a claim not supported by supreme court rulings on the issue fiftyseven teachers from across the state resigned in protest of the bill the maine legislature voted to exempt current school employees but king vetoed

harsh scrutiny of presidential politics where rivals and media hunt for embellishments and omissions that can hobble a campaign cnn characterized the core narrative as acts of violence as an angry

through his atoning sacrifice and that all people are sinners and need his redemption carson has stated he doesnt believe in hell as understood by some christians you know i see god as a very loving individual and why would he torment somebody forever who only had a life of or or years even if they were evil even if they were only evil for years this is fully in line with adventist teaching which promotes annihiliationism consistent with the practice of many adventists carson is a lactoovo vegetarian he will eat dishes containing milk eggs or cheese and occasionally poultry he has said his main reason for becoming vegetarian was health concerns including avoiding parasites and heart disease and he emphasizes the environmental benefits of vegetarianism his transition was made easier because he had eaten little meat for aesthetic reasons as a child and he readily adopted his wifes vegetarianism because she does much of the cooking in their household speaking in he said that with the increasing availability of meat substitutes it might take years but eventually there will no longer be a reason for most people to eat meat and animals will breathe a sigh of relief to avoid causing others discomfort he is willing to occasionally eat chicken or turkey although he finds eating pork highly unpleasant carson has described himself as prolife comparing women who have abortions to historical slave owners and supports overturning the supreme court decision in roe v wade he opposes access to abortion in virtually all cases including pregnancies resulting from incest or rape but would consider allowing its use if a womans health is in danger in august carson said the numberone cause of death for black people is abortion after undercover videos recorded by an antiabortion group showed planned parenthood officials discussing the donation of tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research carson condemned the videos and argued that fetal tissue had no use in medical research saying theres nothing that cant be done without fetal tissue subsequently dr jen gunter an obgyn and blogger identified research that carson himself had performed and published using tissue from fetuses aborted in the th and th weeks of gestation carson defended his past use of tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research in part by stating to not use the tissue that is in a tissue bank regardless of where it comes from would be foolish why would anybody not do that carson also told the washington post if youre killing babies and taking the tissue thats a very different thing than taking a dead specimen and keeping a record of it carson rejects the scientific consensus that human activity causes climate change in november he said theres always going to be either cooling or warming going on and he found the debate on climate change irrelevant and a distraction from protecting the environment in carson expressed his disbelief about the scientific consensus on climate change at a commonwealth club forum in san francisco after this statement governor jerry brown of california sent carson a flash drive containing the intergovernmental panel on climate changes synthesis report which details the scientific evidence of human impact on climate change carsons response to the san francisco chronicle was there is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are mancaused and not naturally caused carson has not fleshed out enough for a tax policy for experts to really run the numbers according to cnn money but has suggested that the us abandon its current personal income tax system in favor of a flat tax along with a flat tax carson has advocated for a national luxury tax on very expensive items carson also supports a balanced budget amendment to the united states constitution in order to combat the national debt and raising the minimum age to receive social security benefits because people are living longer straining the solvency of the program while most of carsons economic policy beliefs reflect current republican orthodoxy he diverges from other republican presidential candidates in his support for reinstating glasssteagall a depressionera law that separated commercial and investment banks and was repealed in carson believes the repeal of glasssteagall helped foster growth in banks that made them too big to fail during the presidential campaign carson initially said the current federal minimum wage of should possibly or probably be higher he supported a twotiered minimum wage system with a lower starter minimum wage for young workers he also supported indexing the minimum wage to inflation so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of america at the fourth republican debate carson argued against increasing the minimum wage and said that just percent of black teens have a job who are looking for one but the bureau of labor statistics says that percent of them have jobs his campaign later clarified that he was referring to the summer jobless rate for black teens as for the size of the federal workforce carson calls it absurd and would reduce it by cutting back on hiring people as an alternative to layoffs regarding international trade carson has said that free trade is a wonderful thing but voiced objections to the transpacific partnership he wants to see the tpp renegotiated because right now we have a lot of special interest groups who benefit when asked about the impact of regulations on the economy carson said even for the average person every single regulation costs money and its shifted to the individual so and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap it costs cents more they notice it and the middle class when they come to the cash register have a whole cart full of things that cost or cents more they notice it it is hurting the poor in an october interview carson stated i actually have something i would use the department of education to do it would be to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding on that basis on the ap us history curriculum carson said it overemphasizes wrongdoing by the united states i think most people when they finish that course theyd be ready to go sign up for isis in february at the annual conservative political action conference carson said ive found that homeschoolers do the best private schoolers next best charter schoolers next best and public schoolers worst on that basis he advocated school choice carsons views on evolution and creationism have been controversial in a debate carson stated i dont believe in evolution i simply dont have enough faith to believe that something as complex as our ability to rationalize think and plan and have a moral sense of whats right and wrong just appeared in a speech to seventhday adventists entitled celebration of creation carson said darwins theory of evolution was encouraged by the adversary and it has become what is scientifically politically correct with the adversary being interpreted as a reference to satan carson also labelled the theory of the big bang as ridiculous saying here you have all these highfalutin scientists and theyre saying it was this gigantic explosion and everything came into perfect order i mean you want to talk about fairy tales that is amazing carson defended his comments in saying in regard to the scientific concepts im not going to denigrate you because of your faith and you shouldnt denigrate me for mine in carson rejected the validity of carbon dating as it really doesnt mean anything to a god who has the ability to create anything at any point in time carson further argued against evolution stating his disbelief in the possibility of the complexity of the human brain arising from a slime pit full of promiscuous biochemicals in october carson stated that he does accept the idea of natural selection but there is only evidence for microevolution changes in allele frequencies that occur over time within a species which he believes was the result of a wise creator who gave his creatures the ability to adapt to their environment so that he wouldnt have to start over every years whereas theres never been one species thats turned into another species that can be proved carson stated in that semiautomatic firearms should be better regulated in large cities and highcrime areas this statement attracted criticism from conservative opponents of gun control carson has declined to backtrack from that view but says he is strongly in favor of the second amendment and while guns being used on innocent people is horrible it is not nearly as horrible as having a population that is defenseless against a group of tyrants who have arms also regarding gun control carson said in october there is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking but i never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away in an interview with cnns wolf blitzer carson asserted that the likelihood of hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed this response echoed the earlier assertion in his book a perfect union that nazi gun control made it easier for the holocaust to occur through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda the nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance some critics and historians have contested carsons views in a piece for the huffington post jonathan greenblatt national director and ceo of the antidefamation league wrote it is mindbending to suggest that personal firearms in the hands of the small number of germanys jews about remaining in germany in could have stopped the totalitarian onslaught of nazi germany when the armies of poland france belgium and numerous other countries were overwhelmed by the third reich others have also defended his views with daniel payne of the federalist writing the issue should not be one of could a civilian militia have defeated the german army and prevented the holocaust rather the question is this if the german government hadnt stripped the german jewish population of arms would it have been easier for the jews to fight back and would more lives have been saved the answer is obviously yes in march when asked about his previous claim that americans were living in a gestapo age carson said that the united states is very much like nazi germany there you had a government using its tools to intimidate a population we now live in a society where people are afraid to say what they actually believe due to pc police politicians and the media which stifle peoples conversation in october carson said he would beg to differ with people who thought america would never become something akin to nazi germany stating if you go back and look at the history of the world tyranny and despotism and how it starts it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech when questioned about whether he was comparing president obama to hitler carson said no i am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves bad things can happen also in that month the washington post labelled carson as the biggest fan of nazi metaphors in politics in america it described carson as someone who doesnt shy away from holding up nazi germany as a dire warning of the slippery slope america is on the washington post listed carsons referring to nazi germany or hitler on various topics including american society and how a general population kept their mouth shut obama supporters socialists gun rights and planned parenthood carson has been critical of the patient protection and affordable care act in carson said you know obamacare is really i think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery and it is in a way it is slavery in a way because it is making all of us subservient to the government and it was never about health care it was about control as an alternative to the affordable care act carson says heres my solution when a person is born give him a birth certificate an electronic medical record and a health savings account in a december oped for the washington times carson elaborated we need to remove health care from the political arena and recognize that any government proposals affecting the health of all citizens should be free marketbased and should be so appealing that it would not be necessary to force citizens into the program to fund health savings accounts carson supports moving dollars out of traditional health care programs like medicaid under a proposal outlined by carson in the government would contribute to each individuals account annually individuals and employers would be permitted to contribute additional funds to the accounts and unspent funds could be shared within a family carson has said that his plan makes every family have their own insurance company separately from his individualaccount proposal in a oped he called for a system similar to medicare and medicaid for a group that carson terms the percent of patients with complex preexisting or acquired maladies in october carson said if someone preferred the current medicare or medicaid programs to the healthsavingsaccount approach im not going to deny you the privilege of doing that in a commencement speech at andrews university carson publicly expressed the view that the pyramids of giza were not tombs but grain silos built by joseph the biblical son of jacob in preparation for the famine depicted in the book of genesis he added that various scientists say ancient aliens could have designed the structures but to carson it doesnt require an alien being when god is with you popular in medieval europe the belief that joseph had the pyramids built as granaries was perpetuated by among others gregory of tours in the sixth century an irish monk in the ninth century named bernard a mosaic in st marks basilica dating from the twelfth and the travelogue attributed to john mandeville in the fourteenth in carson reiterated his views archaeologists disagree saying the pyramids could not be used to store grain because they are not hollow also ancient egyptian granaries have been well studied there is evidence of burials inside the pyramids and the ancient egyptians left funerary instructions inside them additionally the bible states that josephs grain was kept in cities in the washington times carson wrote once illegals have legal status it will be difficult to deny them any of the multitudinous entitlements that are freely distributed throughout our society carson believes that illegal immigrants should be able to register as guest workers and have a pathway to apply for permanent resident status in august carson said he was suggesting we do what we need to do to secure the border whatever that is carson proposed using drone strikes although not on people im not talking about killing people no people with drones instead the drone strikes would be used on the caves that are utilized to hide people illegally entering the united states from mexico as those caves can be eliminated additionally drones can help with the surveillance in september carson said that due to the difficulty in deporting illegal immigrants he would instead prioritize sealing the borders of the united states which in the carson administration that would be done in the first year he also said that you have to also turn off the spigot that dispenses the goodies so that people dont have any incentive to come here in november while speaking to reporters following a campaign stop in mobile alabama carson likened the issue of terrorism as it might relate to the syrian refugee issue saying if theres a rabid dog running around in your neighborhood youre probably not going to assume something good about that dog and youre probably gonna put your children out of the way carson has said i think medical use of marijuana in compassionate cases certainly has been proven to be useful but he opposes legalization of recreational marijuana carson believes marijuana is a gateway drug on the legalization of recreational marijuana in colorado carson said i dont think this is something that we really want for our society you know were gradually just removing all the barriers to hedonistic activity and you know its just were changing so rapidly to a different type of society and nobody is getting a chance to discuss it because you know its taboo in an appearance on glenn becks show carson said he would intensify the war on drugs in march carson described his views about samesex marriage on hannity saying marriage is between a man and a woman no group be they gays be they nambla be they people who believe in bestiality it doesnt matter what they are they dont get to change the definition the comments caused controversy for these remarks carson was accused by glaad of having equated gays with those from the north american manboy love association and supporters of bestiality while discussing on whether marriage should be redefined abc news characterized students of johns hopkins school of medicine being enraged by carsons comparison of homosexuality with bestiality and pedophilia and thus protesting for his removal as their commencement speaker as a result carson acquiesced to their demands and apologized for his remarks saying that he was not equating those groups he said you know as a christiani have a duty to love all people and that includes people who have other sexual orientations and i certainly do and never had any intention of offending anyone what i was basically saying and if anybody was offended i apologize to you but what i was basically saying is that there is no group i wasnt equating those things i dont think theyre equal just you know if you ask me for apple and i give you an orange you would say well thats not an orange and then i say thats a banana thats not an apple either and theres a peach thats not an apple either but it doesnt mean that im equating the banana and the orange and the peach and in the same way im not equating those things carson further said the examples were not the best choice of words adding that the bible says we have an obligation to love our fellow man as ourselves and i love everybody the sameall homosexuals according to carson i was trying to say that as far as marriage was concerned it has traditionally been between a man and a woman and no one should be able to change that carson continued to clarify his comments in later years that point was if you change the definition of marriage for one group youll have to change it for the next group and the next group which was characterized as a slippery slope argument by the washington post in a facebook post carson wrote that he supports civil unions for gay couples and he has for many years carson while on the boards for costco and food manufacturer kelloggs supported initiatives for employment nondiscrimination health insurance for domestic partners and diversity training later in reacting to an ordinance in houston texas that would have permitted those who are transgender to enter a bathroom designated for the gender with which they identify carson proposed the idea of transgender bathrooms saying it is not fair for them to make everybody else uncomfortable i think everybody has equal rights but im not sure that anybody should have extra rights extra rights when it comes to redefining everything for everybody else and imposing your view on everybody else in a march interview with chris cuomo carson stated he believes homosexuality is a choice saying a lot of people go into prison straight and when they come out theyre gay later in a facebook post carson wrote that he realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues i do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation i regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive for that i apologize unreservedly to all that were offended in carsons main national security adviser was robert f dees a retired army major general dees has argued a theme that carson has adopted linking national security to spiritual values dees argues in resilient nations that the greatest threat to america is not terrorism or china or russia but rather the decline of its spiritual infrastructure dees writes at the height of roman decadence good became evil and evil became goodone can rightly argue that the united states is frightfully close to a similar fate prayerfully it is not too late in several interviews carson has endorsed the views of the political theorist w cleon skousen a bestselling author popular among tea party supporters recommending skousens book the naked communist in a july interview carson cited skousen and suggested that nefarious marxist forces were plotting to use the mainstream media to undermine the united states saying there was a guy who was a former cia agent by the name of cleon skousen who wrote a book in called the naked communist and it laid out the whole agenda you would think by reading it that it was written last yearshowing what theyre trying to do to american families what theyre trying to do to our judeochristian faith what theyre doing to morality an endorsement from carson appears on the front cover of the most recent edition of skousens book peter wehner a senior fellow at the ethics and public policy center who served in the last three republican administrations said that carson views skousens work as an interpretive key to america today in a oped article carson argued that the first amendments establishment clause has been reinterpreted by progressives away from its original intent he said in may to try to impose ones religious beliefs on someone else is absolutely what we should not be doing that goes in both directions during a september meet the press interview chuck todd asked carson should a presidents faith matter to voters carson replied that if a faith is inconsistent with the values and principles of america then of course it should matter todd continued with so do you believe that islam is consistent with the constitution to which carson said no i dont i do not believe so i would not advocate that we put a muslim in charge of this nation i absolutely would not agree with that however he maintained that sharia islamic law is something that is against the rights of women against the rights of gays subjugates other religions and a host of things that are not compatible with our constitution in a subsequent interview carson said that anybody doesnt matter what their religious background if they accept american values and principles and are willing to subjugate their religious beliefs to our constitution i have no problem with them some adventists have argued that his political positions on gun rights and religious liberty conflict with historic adventist teachings in favor of nonviolence pacifism and the separation of church and state carson has released a tax plan including a flat tax the rate would apply to both personal and business income it would only apply to income above percent of the federal poverty level though citizens whose income is at or below that level would be required to make an annual de minimis tax payment the plan would eliminate taxation of capital gains dividends and interest at the individual level while also eliminating the alternative minimum tax and the estate tax the plan would do away with deductions and other tax breaks steve forbes has been a big supporter of the plan saying that the one that is the cleanest one so far has come from dr ben carson who introduced a clean flat tax about two or three weeks ago previously carson had proposed the institution of a flat personal corporate income and capital gains tax of claiming inspiration by the biblical concept of tithing carson is a member of the american academy of achievement alpha omega alpha honor medical society and the horatio alger association of distinguished americans carson

the draft and avoid serving in uniform he issued a notarized statement during the presidential campaign i was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to senator fulbrights office that bill clinton a rhodes scholar should be admitted to the rotc program i believe that he purposely deceived me using the possibility of joining the rotc as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his

vietnam this effort was unsuccessful and clinton said in that he had been unaware of it until then although legal clintons actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the

unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens anger over the escape of cuban refugees from the mariel boatlift detained in fort chaffee in monroe schwarzlose of kingsland in cleveland county polled percent

legislation and programs much of which was enacted into law or was implemented by the executive branch his policies particularly the north american free trade agreement and welfare reform have been attributed to a centrist third way philosophy of governance on budgetary matters his policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime

television appearance was a calculated risk but clinton regained several delegates he finished second to tsongas in the new hampshire primary but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning the media viewed it as a victory news outlets labeled him the comeback kid for earning a firm secondplace finish winning the big prizes of florida and texas and many of the southern primaries on super tuesday gave clinton a sizable delegate lead however former california governor jerry brown was scoring victories and clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native south with no major southern state remaining clinton targeted new york which had many delegates he scored a resounding victory in new york city shedding his image as a regional candidate having been transformed into the consensus candidate he secured the democratic party nomination finishing with a victory in jerry browns home state of california during the campaign questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful rose law firm at which hillary rodham clinton was a partner arose clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining hillarys firm pay further concern arose when bill clinton announced that with hillary voters would be getting two presidents for the price of one while campaigning for us president the thengovernor clinton returned to arkansas to see that ricky ray rector would be executed after killing a police officer and a civilian rector shot himself in the head leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death according to arkansas state and federal law a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed the courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution clintons return to arkansas for the execution was framed in a the new york times article as a possible political move to counter soft on crime accusations because bushs approval ratings were around percent during the gulf war he was described as unbeatable however when bush compromised with democrats to try to lower federal deficits he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes hurting his approval rating clinton repeatedly condemned bush for making a promise he failed to keep by election time the economy was souring and bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over percent finally conservatives were previously united by anticommunism but with the end of the cold war the party lacked a uniting issue when pat buchanan and pat robertson addressed christian themes at the republican national conventionwith bush criticizing democrats for omitting god from their platformmany moderates were alienated clinton then pointed to his moderate new democrat record as governor of arkansas though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious many democrats who had supported ronald reagan and bush in previous elections switched their support to clinton clinton and his running mate al gore toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign shoring up support and pledging a new beginning clinton won the presidential election percent of the vote against republican incumbent george h w bush percent of the vote and billionaire populist ross perot who ran as an independent percent of the vote on a platform focusing on domestic issues a significant part of clintons success was bushs steep decline in public approval clintons election ended twelve years of republican rule of the white house and twenty of the previous twentyfour years the election gave democrats full control of the united states congress the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since democrats held the th united states congress during the jimmy carter presidency in the late s clinton was inaugurated as the nd president of the united states on january shortly after taking office clinton signed the family and medical leave act of on february which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition this action had bipartisan support and proved quite popular with the public two days after taking office on january the th anniversary of the us supreme court decision in roe v wade clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by clintons predecessors ronald reagan and george hw bush clinton said that abortion should be kept safe legal and rarea slogan that had been suggested by university of california san diego political scientist samuel l popkin and first used by clinton in december while campaigning during the eight years of the clinton administration the us abortion rate declined by about percent on february clinton made his first address to the nation announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap the budget deficit two days later in a nationally televised address to a joint session of congress clinton unveiled his economic plan the plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class which had been high on his campaign agenda clintons advisers pressured him to raise taxes on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates on may clinton fired seven employees of the white house travel office causing the white house travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause the white house responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief fbi investigation critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the fbi was unwarranted our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal there is nothing wrong with america that cannot be cured by what is right with america clinton signed the omnibus budget reconciliation act of in august of that year which passed congress without a republican vote it cut taxes for fifteen million lowincome families made tax cuts available to percent of small businesses and raised taxes on the wealthiest percent of taxpayers additionally through the implementation of spending restraints it mandated the budget be balanced over a number of years clinton made a major speech to congress regarding a health care reform plan on september aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan this was one of the most prominent items on clintons legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by hillary clinton though at first well received in political circles it was eventually doomed by wellorganized opposition from conservatives the american medical association and the health insurance industry however john f harris a biographer of clintons states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the white house despite the democratic majority in congress the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by george j mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in august it was the first major legislative defeat of clintons administration in november david hale the source of criminal allegations against bill clinton in the whitewater controversy alleged that clinton while governor of arkansas pressured him to provide an illegal loan to susan mcdougal the partner of the clintons in the whitewater land deal a us securities and exchange commission investigation did result in convictions against the mcdougals for their role in the whitewater project but the clintons themselves were never charged and clinton maintains innocence in the affair clinton signed the brady bill into law on november which imposed a fiveday waiting period on handgun purchases he also expanded the earned income tax credit a subsidy for lowincome workers in december of that year allegations by arkansas state troopers larry patterson and roger perry were first reported by david brock in the american spectator later known as troopergate the allegations by these men were that they arranged sexual liaisons for bill clinton back when he was governor of arkansas the story mentioned a woman named paula a reference to paula jones brock later apologized to clinton saying the article was politically motivated bad journalism and that the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives that month clinton implemented a department of defense directive known as dont ask dont tell which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexuality a secret and forbade the military from inquiring about an individuals sexual orientation the policy was developed as a compromise after clintons proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent congressional republicans and democrats including senators john mccain raz and sam nunn dga according to david mixner clintons support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with vice president al gore who felt that the president should lift the ban even though his executive order was sure to be overridden by the congress some gayrights advocates criticized clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions their position was that clinton should have integrated the military by executive order noting that president harry s truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces clintons defenders argue that an executive order might have prompted the senate to write the exclusion of gays into law potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future later in his presidency in clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not out of whack the policy remained controversial and was finally repealed in removing open sexual preference as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces on january clinton signed the north american free trade agreement into law throughout his first year in office clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the us senate clinton and most of his allies in the democratic leadership committee strongly supported free trade measures there remained however strong disagreement within the party opposition came chiefly from antitrade republicans protectionist democrats and supporters of ross perot the bill passed the house with votes against opposed republicans and democrats voting in favor democrats republicans and independent against the treaty was then ratified by the senate and signed into law by the president the omnibus crime bill which clinton signed into law in made many changes to us crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death such as running a largescale drug enterprise during clintons reelection campaign he said my crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins murderers of federal law enforcement officers and nearly additional categories of violent felons when i took office only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the worldwide web now even my cat has its own page the clinton administration also launched the first official white house website whitehousegov on october it was followed by three more versions resulting in the final edition launched in the white house website was part of a wider movement of the clinton administration toward webbased communication according to robert longley clinton and gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies the us court system and the us military onto the internet thus opening up americas government to more of americas citizens than ever before on july clinton issued executive order federal information technology ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public after two years of democratic party control the democrats lost control of congress in the midterm elections in for the first time in forty years ken gormley dean of the school of law at duquesne university in

protection detail and director of the secret service the president was on his way to meet with a senior member of the philippine government when disaster was averted intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating that there was a wedding cake under a bridge this alerted merletti and others as clintons motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown manila once more the word wedding was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade but the alternate route would add fortyfive minutes to the drive time clinton was very angry as he was already late for the meeting however following the advice of the secret service saved his life two other bombs had been discovered in manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high security personnel at the manila international airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag officials also discovered a bomb near a major us naval base the president was scheduled to visit both of these locations later in the week an intense investigation took place into the events in manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a saudi terrorist group in afghanistan known as alqaeda and the plot was masterminded by osama bin laden until recently this thwarted assassination attempt was never made

of marriage act doma which defines marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman allowing individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages performed in other states paul yandura speaking for the white house gay and lesbian liaison office said that clintons signing of doma was a political decision that they made at the time of a reelection in defense of his actions clinton has said that doma was an attempt to head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a very reactionary congress administration spokesman richard socarides said the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse and it was time to move on and get the president reelected clinton himself stated that doma was something which the republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for president bush up i think its obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the republican congress from presenting that others were more critical the veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist evan wolfson has called these claims historic revisionism in a july

his lobbying failed to pass the senate by a single vote in advocacy for these issues paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time led to enthusiastic support for clintons election and reelection by the human rights campaign clinton came out for gay marriage in july and urged the supreme court to overturn doma in he was later honored by glaad for his prior

impeachment the house began impeachment hearings against clinton before the midterm elections to hold impeachment proceedings the republican leadership called a lameduck session in december  while the house judiciary committee hearings ended in a straight partyline vote there was lively debate on the house floor the two charges passed in the house largely with republican support but with a handful of democratic votes as well were for perjury and obstruction of justice the perjury charge arose from clintons testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during paula joness sexual harassment lawsuit the obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with lewinsky before and after that deposition the senate later acquitted clinton on both charges the senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term so the trial was held over until the next congress clinton was represented by washington law firm williams connolly the senate finished a twentyoneday trial on february with the vote of not guilty guilty on the perjury charge and not guilty guilty on

wide support in the conservative and moderate wings of the republican party and his immigrant past offsets mccains white heritage if mccain had won the presidency he would have been the oldest president ever inaugurated to a first term heightening the speculation mccain invited jindal gov charlie crist of florida gov tim pawlenty of minnesota and mccains former rivals mitt romney and mike huckabee to meet at mccains home in arizona on may according to a republican familiar with the decision romney huckabee and pawlenty all of whom were already well acquainted with mccain declined because of prior commitments the meeting may have served a different purpose such as consideration of jindal for the opportunity to speak at the republican national convention in a similar fashion to barack obama at the democratic national convention cementing a place for him in the party and opening the gate for a future run for the presidency speculation was fueled by simultaneous july reports

jindal states that since government failed during hurricane katrina we should understand not that government should not be allowed to fail again but that governmentnever works that government cant work and therefore we should stop seeking a functioning government david johnson a republican political strategist criticized jindals mention of hurricane katrina stating the one thing republicans want to forget is katrina while jindals speech was poorly received by several democratic and republican critics others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style jindals story of meeting lee in the immediate aftermath of hurricane katrina was questioned following the speech as jindal was not in new orleans at the time on february a spokesman for jindal clarified the timing of the meeting stating that the story took place days after the storm the opportunity to give the response speech to the very popular president obama was compared by some commentators to winning second prize in a beauty contest a reference to the board game monopoly jindal had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidential election on december jindal indicated that he would likely not run for president in saying he will focus on his reelection in and that this would make transitioning to a national campaign difficult though he later attempted to

president obamas first address to a joint session of congress the jindal for president draft council inc pac was formed in to raise funds for a future presidential run jindal has stated that he has no involvement with the pac in april while speaking at the southern republican leadership conference jindal ruled out running for the republican nomination for president in  in jindal traveled across the

weeks following the september terrorist attacks in she received a phone call from michael hayden then the director of the national security agency asking her assistance in providing hp computer

to the washington beltway where they were escorted by nsa security to the agencys fort meade headquarters in fiorina said i felt it was my duty to help and so we did adding they were ramping up a

fiorina provide advice to the agency on how the cia could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and

program ipodhp sales represented only a small portion of total ipod sales in july soon after fiorina resigned as ceo her successor mark hurd ended hps agreement with apple within days of taking office a highly symbolic decision that was wellreceived as a return to innovation by hp steven levy writing in on the agreement wrote that steve jobs blithely mugged her and hps shareholders by getting fiorina to adopt the ipod as hps music player jobs had effectively gotten his itunes software installed on millions of computers for free stifled his main competitor and gotten a company that prided itself on invention to declare that apple was a superior inventor and he lost nothing  in january hp laid off marketing employees in june fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs resulting in more than people signing up and saving hp us million despite these efforts from employees in july fiorina announced that jobs would be cut

sp information technology sector index and the nasdaq by contrast stock prices for ibm and dell fell by and respectively during this time the compaq acquisition was not as transformative as fiorina

in  in hp fell dramatically short of its predicted thirdquarter earnings and fiorina fired three executives during a am telephone call in early january the hewlettpackard board of directors discussed with fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the companys performance and disappointing earning reports the board proposed a plan to shift her authority to hp division heads which fiorina resisted strongly a week after the meeting the confidential plan was leaked to the wall street journal according to businessweeks ben elgin directors were also concerned about the boards

charismatic but selfcentered and demanding styles the same year wharton school of business professor michael useem opined fiorina scored high on leadership style but she failed to execute strategy following her forced resignation from hp several commentators ranked fiorina as one of the worst american or tech ceos of all time in infoworld grouped her with a list of products and ideas that flopped declaring that her tenure as ceo of hp was the sixth worst tech flop of all time and characterizing her as the antisteve jobs for reversing the goodwill of geeks and alienating existing customers during fiorinas tenure as ceo hp leased or purchased five planes including two gulfstream ivs to replace four aging aircraft only one of which had the range to fly overseas one gulfstream iv acquired at a cost of us million and available for fiorinas exclusive use became a rallying point among hp employees who complained of fiorinas expensive selfpromotion and topdown managerial style

political adviser karl rove after christies law partner william palatucci a republican political consultant and bush supporter boasted that he had selected a united states attorney by forwarding christies rsum to rove according to new jerseys senior senator bob torricelli christie promised to appoint a professional with federal courtroom experience as deputy if confirmed by senate tradition if a states senior senator opposes the nomination of a us attorney the nomination is effectively dead but christies promise was enough for torricelli to give the nomination his blessing he was unanimously confirmed by the united states senate on december and sworn into office on january  the brother of christies uncle his aunts second husband tino fiumara was an organized crime figure

senator wayne r bryant in on charges of bribery mail fraud and wire fraud according to rachel barkow and anthony barkow both of nyu law school christie negotiated seven deal deferred prosecution agreements dpas during his tenure some of which were controversial under agreements like these corporations avoid prosecution if they promise not just to obey the law or pay for bad acts but also promise to change personnel or revamp business practices or adopt new types of corporate governance they are typically used in lieu of prosecution when there is evidence of particularly egregious corporate misconduct since these types of agreements have been sharply on the rise among federal prosecutors with between and and between and outside monitors are appointed in about half of all dpas to make sure that the corporations comply in one case christie recommended appointment of the ashcroft group a consulting firm owned by his former boss john ashcroft as an outside monitor of zimmer holdingsa contract worth as much as million from zimmer which was an amount in line with fee structures at that time in another instance christies office deferred criminal prosecution of pharmaceutical company bristol myers in a deal that required the company to dedicate million for a business ethics chair at seton hall university school of law christies alma mater christie defended the appointment of ashcroft as someone with the necessary prominence and legal acumen and he defended the seton hall donation as happenstance given that there was already a business ethics endowed chair at the only other law school in the state still cases like these led to new rules within the justice department and sparked a congressional hearing on the subject besides doubling the size of

been on a preliminary version of the hit list new york senator charles schumer said i was shocked when i saw chris christies name on the list last night it just shows a justice department that has run amok pat meehan the us attorney in philadelphia said among his peers chris stands out as one of the most admired if you were to create a list of the us attorneys who have had the greatest impact chris would be one of the top two or three names id put on it this defies explanation christies opponents claimed that he had gotten off the bush administrations hit list by going after congressman robert menendez for example new york times columnist paul krugman wrote menendezs claims of persecution now seem quite plausible christie had issued a subpoena regarding menendez days before the senate election in which menendez defeated republican thomas kean jr to become new jerseys junior senator christies biographers journalists michael symons and bob ingle concluded that the timing of the menendezrelated subpoena doesnt line up right to support the critics theory christies aides have said that the subpoena was prompted by a newspaper report about menendez which prosecutors feared might imminently lead to destruction of documents and other evidence the investigation of menendez continued for years after christie left office as us attorney until menendez was finally cleared on october

gubernatorial contest in and those financial resources were intended to support a major outreach effort toward blacks hispanics and women he also ordered a million special election to fill the seat of the deceased senator frank lautenberg the move was believed to be motivated by a desire to keep newark mayor cory booker from sharing an election day days afterward with christie thereby depressing

bridge and new york city were closed on orders from a senior christie aide and a christie administration appointee the lane closures in the morning rush hour resulted in massive traffic backups on the

restrict campaign contributions from financial corporation executives to governors running for federal office when the companies do business with the governors state a memo from the campaign

jewish daughter and i am very honored by that it wasnt in the plan but i am very glad it happened in february while on his way home following a visit to mexico pope francis said the following a person who thinks only about building wallswherever they may beand not building bridges is not christian id just say that this man trump is not christian if he said it this way we must see if he said things in that way and in this i give the benefit of the doubt trump responded that it was disgraceful for the pope to question his faith and suggested that the mexican government was using the pope as a pawn for political purposes because they want to continue to rip off the united states trump said that if and when the islamic state isil attacks the vatican the pope would have wished and prayed trump were president because under trumps leadership such an attack would not happen shortly thereafter director of the holy see press office federico lombardi insisted that the pope was in no way launching an attack on donald trump nor was he trying to sway voters by declaring someone who advocates building walls isnt christian the spokesman said that the pope has made it clear that he would not enter into the presidential election campaign in the united states and indeed the headlines in the united states had gone considerably beyond what the pope had actually said after the clarification by lombardi trump retracted his criticism of the pope i dont think this is a fight said trump i think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media trump has never done drugs or smoked cigarettes and has always heeded a warning from his older brother an alcoholic to not drink alcohol he also has germaphobic tendencies and therefore prefers not to shake

competition he was beyond the age limit for the naval academy he then accepted an appointment to west point in  at west point eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports but was less enthusiastic about the hazing though he willingly accepted it as a plebe he was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating academically eisenhowers best subject by far was english otherwise his performance was average though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics in athletics

national chairman clifford roberts inviting roberts to stay at the white house on several occasions roberts an investment broker also handled the eisenhower familys investments roberts also advised eisenhower on tax aspects of publishing his memoirs which proved financially lucrative after golf oil painting was eisenhowers second hobby while at columbia university eisenhower began the art after watching thomas e stephens paint mamies portrait eisenhower painted about oils during the last years of his life to relax mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as mamie their grandchildren general montgomery george washington and abraham lincoln wendy beckett stated that eisenhowers work simple and earnest rather cause us to wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president a conservative in both art and politics he in a speech denounced modern art as a piece of canvas that looks like a brokendown tin lizzie loaded with paint has been driven over it angels in the outfield was eisenhowers favorite movie his favorite reading material for relaxation were the western novels of zane grey with his excellent memory and ability to focus eisenhower was skilled at card games he learned poker which he called his favorite indoor sport in abilene eisenhower recorded west point classmates poker losses for payment after graduation and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him a classmate reported that after learning to play contract bridge at west point eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months eisenhower continued to play bridge throughout his military career while stationed in the philippines he played regularly with president manuel quezon and was dubbed the bridge wizard of manila during wwii an unwritten qualification for an officers appointment to eisenhowers staff was the ability to play a sound game of bridge he played even during the stressful weeks leading up to the dday landings his favorite partner was general alfred gruenther considered the best player in the us army he appointed gruenther his secondincommand at nato partly because of his skill at bridge saturday night bridge games at the white house were a feature of his presidency he was a strong player though not an expert by modern standards the great bridge player and popularizer ely culbertson described his game as classic and sound with flashes of brilliance and said that you can always judge a mans character by the way he plays cards eisenhower is a calm and collected player and never whines at his losses he is brilliant in victory but never commits the bridge players worst crime of gloating when he wins bridge expert oswald jacoby frequently participated in the white house games and said the president plays better bridge than golf he tries to break at golf at bridge you would say he plays in the s after graduation in lieutenant nd eisenhower put in for assignment in the philippines which was denied he served with the infantry initially in logistics until at various camps in texas and georgia in while stationed at fort sam houston eisenhower was football coach for st louis college now st marys university in late while in charge of training at ft oglethorpe in georgia mamie had their first son when the us entered world war i he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to ft leavenworth kansas in february he was transferred to camp meade in maryland with the th engineers his unit was later ordered to france but to his chagrin he received orders for the new tank corps where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the national army he commanded a unit that trained tank crews at camp colt his first command at the site of picketts charge on the gettysburg pennsylvania civil war battleground though eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers strengths and make optimal placements of personnel once again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to france this time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed just a week before departure completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time despite being given the distinguished service medal for his work at homecitation needed in world war ii rivals who had combat service in the first great war led by gen bernard montgomery sought to denigrate eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty despite his stateside experience establishing a camp completely equipped for thousands of troops and developing a full combat training schedule after the war eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major a rank he held for years the major was assigned in to a transcontinental army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation indeed the convoy averaged only mph from washington dc to san francisco later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for eisenhower as president he assumed duties again at camp meade maryland commanding a battalion of tanks where he remained until his schooling continued focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it his new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with george s patton sereno e brett and other senior tank leaders their leadingedge ideas of speedoriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry eisenhower was even threatened with court martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment and he relented from eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals fox conner john j pershing douglas macarthur and george marshall he first became executive officer to general conner in the panama canal zone where joined by mamie he served until under conners tutelage he studied military history and theory including carl von clausewitzs on war and later cited conners enormous influence on his military thinking saying in that fox conner was the ablest man i ever knew conners comment on eisenhower was he is one of the most capable efficient and loyal officers i have ever met on conners recommendation in he attended the command and general staff college at fort leavenworth kansas where he graduated first in a class of officers he then served as a battalion commander at fort benning georgia until  during the late s and early s eisenhowers career in the postwar army stalled somewhat as military priorities diminished many of his friends resigned for highpaying business jobs he was assigned to the american battle monuments commission directed by general pershing and with the help of his brother milton eisenhower then a journalist at the agriculture department he produced a guide to american battlefields in europe he then was assigned to the army war college and graduated in after a oneyear assignment in france eisenhower served as executive officer to general george v mosely assistant secretary of war from to february major dwight d eisenhower graduated from the army industrial college washington dc in and later served on the faculty it was later expanded to become the industrial college of the armed services and is now known as the dwight d eisenhower school for national security and resource strategy his primary duty was planning for the next war which proved most difficult in the midst of the great depression he then was posted as chief military aide to general macarthur army chief of staff in he participated in the clearing of the bonus march encampment in washington dc although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised macarthur against taking a public role in it he later wrote the armys official incident report endorsing macarthurs conduct in he accompanied macarthur to the philippines where he served as assistant military adviser to the philippine government in developing their army eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with his patron regarding the role of the philippine army and the leadership qualities that an american army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates the dispute and resulting antipathy between eisenhower and macarthur lasted the rest of their lives historians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of winston churchill george s patton george marshall and general montgomery during world war ii eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with macarthur and that a positive relationship endured while in manila mamie suffered a lifethreatening stomach ailment but recovered fully eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in he also learned to fly making a solo flight over the philippines in and obtained his private pilots license in at fort lewis also around this time he was offered a post by the philippine commonwealth government namely by then philippine president manuel l quezon on recommendations by macarthur to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned now named quezon city but he declined the offer eisenhower returned to the us in december and was assigned as a battalion commander and regimental executive officer of the th infantry at fort lewis washington in march he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated ix corps under major general kenyon joyce in june he was appointed chief of staff to general walter krueger commander of the rd army at fort sam houston in san antonio texas after successfully participating in the louisiana maneuvers he was promoted to brigadier general on october although his administrative abilities had been noticed on the eve of the us entry into world war ii he had never held an active command above a battalion and was far from being considered by many as a potential commander of major operations after the japanese attack on pearl harbor eisenhower was assigned to the general staff in washington where he served until june with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat japan and germany he was appointed deputy chief in charge of pacific defenses under the chief of war plans division wpd general leonard t gerow and then succeeded gerow as chief of the war plans division next he was appointed assistant chief of staff in charge of the new operations division which replaced wpd under chief of staff general george c marshall who spotted talent and promoted accordingly at the end of may eisenhower accompanied lt gen henry h arnold commanding general of the army air forces to london to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in england maj gen james e chaney he returned to washington on june with a pessimistic assessment stating he had an uneasy feeling about chaney and his staff on june he returned to london as commanding general european theater of operations etousa based in london and with a house on coombe kingston upon thames and replaced chaney he was promoted to lieutenant general on july  in november he was also appointed supreme commander allied expeditionary force of the north african theater of operations natousa through the new operational headquarters allied expeditionary force headquarters aefhq the word expeditionary was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons the campaign in north africa was designated operation torch and was planned underground within the rock of gibraltar eisenhower was the first nonbritish person to command gibraltar in years french cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign and eisenhower encountered a preposterous situation with the multiple rival factions in france his primary objective was to move forces successfully into tunisia and intending to facilitate that objective he gave his support to franois darlan as high commissioner in north africa despite darlans previous high offices of state in vichy france and his continued role as commanderinchief of the french armed forces the allied leaders were thunderstruck by this from a political standpoint though none of them had offered eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation eisenhower was severely criticized for the move darlan was assassinated on december by fernand bonnier de la chapelle eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of bonnier de la chapelle by associates of darlan acting without authority from either vichy or the allies considering it a criminal rather than a military matter eisenhower later appointed general henri giraud as high commissioner who had been installed by the allies as darlans commanderinchief and who had refused to postpone the execution operation torch also served as a valuable training ground for eisenhowers combat command skills during the initial phase of generalfeldmarschall erwin rommels move into the kasserine pass eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates he also was initially indecisive in his removal of lloyd fredendall commanding us ii corps he became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns in february his authority was extended as commander of afhq across the mediterranean basin to include the british eighth army commanded by general sir bernard montgomery the eighth army had advanced across the western desert from the east and was ready for the start of the tunisia campaign eisenhower gained his fourth star and gave up command of etousa to become commander of natousa after the capitulation of axis forces in north africa eisenhower oversaw the highly successful invasion of sicily once mussolini the italian leader had fallen in italy the allies switched their attention to the mainland with operation avalanche but while eisenhower argued with president roosevelt and british prime minister churchill who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the italians the germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country making the job more difficult by adding divisions and initially outnumbering the allied forces to nevertheless the invasion of italy was highly successful in december president roosevelt decided that eisenhower not marshall would be supreme allied commander in europe the following month he resumed command of etousa and the following month was officially designated as the supreme allied commander of the allied expeditionary force shaef serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in europe in may he was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the allied assault on the coast of normandy in june under the code name operation overlord the liberation of western europe and the invasion of germany eisenhower as well as the officers and troops under him had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the germansa beach landing assault his first struggles however were with allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the normandy invasion he argued with roosevelt over an essential agreement with de gaulle to use french resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the germans in advance of overlord admiral ernest j king fought with eisenhower over kings refusal to provide additional landing craft from the pacific he also insisted that the british give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate overlord to the point of threatening to resign unless churchill relented as he did eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in france in advance of overlord and argued with churchill over the latters concern with civilian casualties de gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the germans and eisenhower prevailed he also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly george s patton by severely reprimanding him when patton earlier had slapped a subordinate and then when patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy the dday normandy landings on june were costly but successful two months later august the invasion of southern france took place and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the afhq to the shaef many prematurely considered that victory in europe would come by summers endhowever the germans did not capitulate for almost a year from then until the end of the war in europe on may eisenhower through shaef commanded all allied forces and through his command of etousa had administrative command of all us forces on the western front north of the alps he was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families this prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion eisenhowers sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed it has been called one of the great speeches of history our landings in the cherbourghavre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and i have withdrawn the troops my decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone once the coastal assault had succeeded eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through france on germany field marshal montgomery insisted priority be given to his st army groups attack being made in the north while generals bradley th us army group and devers sixth us army group insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front respectively eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize allied forces often by giving them tactical though sometimes ineffective latitude many historians conclude this delayed the allied victory in europe however due to eisenhowers persistence the pivotal supply port at antwerp was successfully albeit belatedly opened in late and victory became a more distinct probability in recognition of his senior position in the allied command on december he was promoted to general of the army equivalent to the rank of field marshal in most european armies in this and the previous high commands he held eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy although he had never seen action himself he won the respect of frontline commanders he interacted adeptly with allies such as winston churchill field marshal bernard montgomery and general charles de gaulle he had serious disagreements with churchill and montgomery over questions of strategy but these rarely upset his relationships with them he dealt with soviet marshal zhukov his russian counterpart and they became good friends the germans launched a surprise counter offensive in the battle of the bulge in december which the allies turned back in early after eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the air force to engage german defenses continued to deteriorate on both the eastern front with the soviets and the western front with the allies the british wanted berlin but eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack berlin and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit the british backed down but then wanted eisenhower to move into czechoslovakia for political reasons washington refused to support churchills plan to use eisenhowers army for political maneuvers against moscow the actual division of germany followed the lines that roosevelt churchill and stalin had previously agreed upon the soviet red army captured berlin in a very largescale bloody battle and the germans finally surrendered on may  following the german unconditional surrender eisenhower was appointed military governor of the us occupation zone based at the ig farben building in frankfurt am main he had no responsibility for the other three zones controlled by britain france and the soviet union except for the city of berlin which was managed by the fourpower authorities through the allied kommandatura as the governing body upon discovery of the nazi concentration camps he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the nuremberg trials he reclassified german prisoners of war pows in us custody as disarmed enemy forces defs who were no longer subject to the geneva convention eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the joint chiefs of staff jcs in directive jcs but softened them by bringing in tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization in response to the devastation in germany including food shortages and an influx of refugees he arranged distribution of american food and medical equipment his actions reflected the new american attitudes of the german people as nazi victims not villains while aggressively purging the exnazis in november eisenhower returned to washington to replace marshall as chief of staff of the army his main role was rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers a slow job that was delayed by lack of shipping eisenhower was convinced in that the soviet union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained he strongly supported the new united nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs however in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the soviets truman was guided by the us state department and ignored eisenhower and the pentagon indeed eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the japanese writing first the japanese were ready to surrender and it wasnt necessary to hit them with that awful thing second i hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon initially eisenhower was characterized by hopes for cooperation with the soviets he even visited warsaw in invited by bolesaw bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city however by mid as eastwest tensions over economic recovery in germany and the greek civil war escalated eisenhower gave up and agreed with a containment policy to stop soviet expansion in june a visiting politician had suggested to eisenhower that he might become president of the united states after the war believing that a general should not participate in politics one author later wrote that figuratively speaking eisenhower kicked his politicalminded visitor out of his office as others asked him about his political future eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job from dogcatcher to grand high supreme king of the universe and another that he could not serve as army chief of staff if others believed he had political ambitions in truman told eisenhower during the potsdam conference that if desired the president would help the general win the election and in he offered to run as eisenhowers running mate on the democratic ticket if macarthur won the republican nomination as the election approached other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged eisenhower to run for president in january after learning of plans in new hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming republican national convention eisenhower stated through the army that he was not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office lifelong professional soldiers he wrote in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason should abstain from seeking high political office eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president republican thomas e dewey was considered the other probable winner would presumably serve two terms and eisenhower at age in would then be too old in eisenhower became president of columbia university an ivy league university in new york city the assignment was described as not being a good fit in either direction during that year eisenhowers memoir crusade in europe was published critics regarded it as one of the finest us military memoirs and it was a major financial success as well eisenhowers profit on the book was substantially aided by an unprecedented ruling by the us department of the treasury that eisenhower was not a professional writer but rather marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences and thus he only had to pay capital gains tax on his advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate this ruling saved eisenhower about  eisenhowers stint as the president of columbia university was punctuated by his activity within the council on foreign relations a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the marshall plan and the american assembly eisenhowers vision of a great cultural center where business professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature his biographer blanche wiesen cook suggested that this period served as the political education of general eisenhower since he had to prioritize wideranging educational administrative and financial demands for the university through his involvement in the council on foreign relations he also gained exposure to economic analysis which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy whatever general eisenhower knows about economics he has learned at the study group meetings one aid to europe member claimed eisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote the american form of democracy through education he was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee he informed them that his main purpose was to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy as a result he was almost incessantly devoted to the idea of the american assembly a concept he developed into an institution by the end of  within months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university eisenhower was requested to advise us secretary of defense james forrestal on the unification of the armed services about six months after his appointment he became the informal chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in washington two months later he fell ill and he spent over a month in recovery at the augusta national golf club he returned to his post in new york in midmay and in july took a twomonth vacation outofstate because the american assembly had begun to take shape he traveled around the country during midtolate building financial support from columbia associates an alumni association eisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the columbia university faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests as a career military man he naturally had little in common with the academics the contacts gained through university and american assembly fundraising activities would later become important supporters in eisenhowers bid for the republican party nomination and the presidency meanwhile columbia universitys liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university presidents ties to oilmen and businessmen including leonard mccollum the president of continental oil frank abrams the chairman of standard oil of new jersey bob kleberg the president of the king ranch h j porter a texas oil executive bob woodruff the president of the cocacola corporation and clarence francis the chairman of general foods as the president of columbia eisenhower gave voice and form to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of american democracy his tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership his biographer travis beal jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years the trustees of columbia university refused to accept eisenhowers resignation in december when he took an extended leave from the university to become the supreme commander of the north atlantic treaty organization nato and he was given operational command of nato forces in europe eisenhower retired from active service as an army general on may and he resumed his presidency of columbia he held this position until january when he became the president of the united states nato did not have strong bipartisan support in congress at the time that eisenhower assumed its military command eisenhower advised the participating european nations that it would be incumbent upon them to demonstrate their own commitment of troops and equipment to the nato force before such would come from the warweary united states at home eisenhower was more effective in making the case for nato in congress than the truman administration was by the middle of american and european support for nato was substantial enough to give it a genuine military power nevertheless eisenhower thought that nato would become a truly european alliance with the american and canadian commitments ending after about ten years president truman symbolizing a broadbased desire for an eisenhower candidacy for president again in pressed him to run for the office as a democrat it was at this time that eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the democratic party and declared himself and his family to be republicans a draft eisenhower movement in the republican party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the presidential election to counter the candidacy of noninterventionist senator robert a taft the effort was a long struggle eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their president henry cabot lodge who served as his campaign manager and others succeeded in convincing him and in june he resigned his command at nato to campaign fulltime eisenhower defeated taft for the nomination having won critical delegate votes from texas eisenhowers campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan i like ike it was essential to his success that eisenhower express opposition to roosevelts policy at yalta and against trumans policies in korea and chinamatters in which he had once participated in defeating taft for the nomination it became necessary for eisenhower to appease the right wing old guard of the republican party his selection of richard m nixon as the vicepresident on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose nixon also provided a strong anticommunist presence as well as some youth to counter ikes more advanced age in the general election against the advice of his advisors eisenhower insisted on campaigning in the south refusing to surrender the region to the democratic party the campaign strategy dubbed kc was to focus on attacking the truman and roosevelt administrations on three issues korea communism and corruption in an effort to accommodate the right he stressed that the liberation of eastern europe should be by peaceful means only he also distanced himself from his former boss president truman two controversies during the campaign tested him and his staff but did not affect the campaign one involved a report that nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates the second issue centered on eisenhowers relented decision to confront the controversial methods of joseph mccarthy on his home turf in a wisconsin appearance just two weeks prior to the election eisenhower vowed to go to korea and end the war there he promised to maintain a strong commitment against communism while avoiding the topic of nato finally he stressed a corruptionfree frugal administration at home he defeated democratic candidate adlai stevenson in a landslide with an electoral margin of to marking the first republican return to the white house in years in the election he also brought with him a republican majority in the house by eight votes and in the senate actually a tie with nixon providing the majority vote eisenhower was the last president born in the th century and at age was the oldest man elected president since james buchanan in president truman stood at in as the incumbent president having succeeded to the presidency in upon the death of franklin roosevelt eisenhower was the only general to serve as president in the th century and the most recent president to have never held elected office prior to the presidency the other presidents who did not have prior elected office were zachary taylor ulysses s grant william howard taft and herbert hoover due to a complete estrangement between the two as a result of campaigning truman and eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations after selecting his budget director joseph m dodge eisenhower asked herbert brownell and lucius clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments he accepted their recommendations without exception they included john foster dulles and george m humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships and one woman oveta culp hobby eisenhowers cabinet consisting of several corporate executives and one labor leader was dubbed by one journalist eight millionaires and a plumber the cabinet was notable for its lack of personal friends office seekers or experienced government administrators he also upgraded the role of the national security council in planning all phases of the cold war prior to his inauguration eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at pearl harbor addressing foremost issues agreed objectives were to balance the budget during his term to bring the korean war to an end to defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent and to end price and wage controls eisenhower also conducted the first preinaugural cabinet meeting in history in late he used this meeting to articulate his anticommunist russia policy his inaugural address as well was exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the united nations eisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any previous president holding almost over his two terms while he saw the benefit of maintaining a good relationship with the press he saw more value in them as a means of direct communication with the american people throughout his presidency eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism a selfdescribed progressive conservative he continued all the major new deal programs still in operation especially social security he expanded its programs and rolled them into a new cabinetlevel agency the department of health education and welfare while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers he implemented integration in the armed services in two years which had not been completed under truman as the congressional elections approached and it became evident that the republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses eisenhower was among those blaming the old guard for the losses and took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the gop eisenhower then articulated his position as a moderate progressive republican i have just one purpose and that is to build up a strong progressive republican party in this country if the right wing wants a fight they are going to get it before i end up either this republican party will reflect progressivism or i wont be with them anymore initially eisenhower planned on serving only one term but as with other decisions he maintained a position of maximum flexibility in case leading republicans wanted him to run again during his recovery from a heart attack late in he huddled with his closest advisors to evaluate the gops potential candidates the group in addition to his doctor concluded a second term was well advised and he announced in february he would run again eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about nixons repeating as the vice president on his ticket the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition he personally favored robert b anderson a democrat who rejected his offer eisenhower then resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party in eisenhower faced adlai stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide with of electoral votes and of the popular vote the level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations eisenhower valued the brief respites and the amenities of an office which he endowed with an arduous daily schedule he made full use of his valet chauffeur and secretarial supporthe rarely drove or dialed a phone number he was an avid fisherman golfer painter and bridge player and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment on august eisenhower was aboard the maiden flight of air force one which replaced the previous presidential aircraft the columbine one of eisenhowers enduring achievements was championing and signing the bill that authorized the interstate highway system in he justified the project through the federal aid highway act of as essential to american security during the cold war it was believed that large cities would be targets in a possible war hence the highways were designed to facilitate their evacuation and ease military maneuvers eisenhowers goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the us armys transcontinental motor convoy he was assigned as an observer for the mission which involved sending a convoy of us army vehicles coast to coast his subsequent experience with encountering german autobahn limitedaccess road systems during the concluding stages of world war ii convinced him of the benefits of an interstate highway system noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country he thought an interstate highway system in the us would not only be beneficial for military operations but provide a measure of continued economic growth the legislation initially stalled in the congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project but the legislative effort was renewed and the law was signed by eisenhower in june  in the republican partys old guard presented eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the yalta agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the executive branch however the death of joseph stalin in march made the matter a moot point at this time eisenhower gave his chance for peace speech in which he attempted unsuccessfully to forestall the nuclear arms race with the soviet union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials biographer stephen ambrose opined that this was the best speech of eisenhowers presidency nevertheless the cold war escalated during his presidency when the soviet union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late november eisenhower against the advice of dulles decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the soviets in an attempt to make their refusal more difficult he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses such as power generation this approach was labeled atoms for peace the un speech was well received but the soviets never acted upon it due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the us arsenal indeed eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons while reducing conventional forces and with them the overall defense budget a policy formulated as a result of project solarium and expressed in nsc this approach became known as the new look and was initiated with defense cuts in late  in american nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament the failure of negotiations over arms until was due mainly to the refusal of the russians to permit any sort of inspections in talks located in london that year they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections the tables were then turned on eisenhower when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the us to permit inspections in may of that year the russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to austria and paved the way for a geneva summit with the us uk and france at the geneva conference eisenhower presented a proposal called open skies to facilitate disarmament which included plans for russia and the us to provide mutual access to each others skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure russian leader nikita khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand in eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in southeast asia and also in central america he believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in vietnam this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism from laos through malaysia and indonesia ultimately to india likewise the fall of guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring mexico that year the loss of north vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed european defence community edc were serious defeats but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism saying long faces dont win wars as he had threatened the french in their rejection of edc he afterwards moved to restore west germany as a full nato partner with eisenhowers leadership and dulles direction cia activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries the cia in part deposed the leaders of iran in operation ajax of guatemala through operation pbsuccess and possibly the newly independent republic of the congo lopoldville in eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the soviet union with dulles recommendation he authorized the deployment of thirty lockheed us at a cost of million the eisenhower administration also planned the bay of pigs invasion to overthrow fidel castro in cuba which john f kennedy was left to carry out over new york city in eastern airlines flight a commercial flight had a near miss with air force flight a lockheed c constellation known as columbine ii while the latter was carrying president eisenhower this prompted the adoption of the unique call sign air force one to be used whenever the president is on board any us air force aircraft columbine ii is the only presidential aircraft to have ever been sold to the public the aircraft was purchased by dynamic aviation in and in collaboration with the mid america flight museum was restored to flying condition on march columbine ii was flown to virginia where restoration work will continue eisenhower and the cia had known since at least january nine months before sputnik that russia had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year he may also privately have welcomed the russian satellite for its legal implications by launching a satellite russia had in effect acknowledged that space was open to anyone who could access it without needing permission from other nations on the whole eisenhowers support of the nations fledgling space program was officially modest until the soviet launch of sputnik in gaining the cold war enemy enormous prestige around the world he then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education his open skies policy attempted to legitimize illegal lockheed u flyovers and project genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory created nasa as a civilian space agency signed a landmark science education law and fostered improved relations with american scientists in strategic terms it was eisenhower who devised the american basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of b bombers landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms and polaris submarinelaunched ballistic missiles slbms eisenhower later resented the space program and its gargantuan price taghe was quoted as saying anyone who would spend billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts in late eisenhower went to korea and discovered a military and political stalemate once in office when the chinese began a buildup in the kaesong sanctuary he threatened to use nuclear force if an armistice was not concluded his earlier military reputation in europe was effective with the chinese the national security council the joint chiefs of staff and the strategic air command sac devised detailed plans for nuclear war against china with the death of stalin in early march russian support for a chinese hardline weakened and china decided to compromise on the prisoner issue in july an armistice took effect with korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in the armistice and boundary remain in effect today with american soldiers stationed there to guarantee it the armistice concluded despite opposition from secretary dulles south korean president syngman rhee and also within eisenhowers party has been described by biographer ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable and limited war unwinnable a point of emphasis in ikes campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment this remained his preference despite the armistice with korea throughout his terms eisenhower took a hardline attitude toward china as demanded by conservative republicans with the goal of driving a wedge between china and the soviet union eisenhower continued trumans policy of recognizing the republic of china based in formosataiwan as the legitimate government of china not the beijing regime there were localized flareups when the red army began shelling the islands of quemoy and matsu in september eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the chinese communists he thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded the sinoamerican mutual defense treaty with taiwan was signed in december he requested and secured from congress their formosa resolution in january which gave eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of formosa and the pescadores the resolution bolstered the morale of the chinese nationalists and signaled to beijing that the us was committed to holding the line eisenhower openly threatened the chinese with use of nuclear weapons authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled operation teapot nevertheless he left the chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response this allowed eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectivesthe end of this communist encroachment the retention of the islands by the chinese nationalists and continued peace defense of taiwan from an invasion remains a core american policy by the end of eisenhowers military and foreign policy expertsthe nsc jcs and state depthad unanimously urged him on no less than five occasions to launch an atomic attack against china yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace even before he was inaugurated eisenhower accepted a request from the british government to restore the shah mohammad reza pahlavi to power he therefore authorized the central intelligence agency to overthrow prime minister mohammad mosaddegh this resulted in an increased strategic control over iranian oil by us and british companies in november eisenhower forced an end to the combined british french and israeli invasion of egypt in response to the suez crisis receiving praise from egyptian president gamal abdel nasser simultaneously he condemned the brutal soviet invasion of hungary in response to the hungarian revolution of he publicly disavowed his allies at the united nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from egypt eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against britain and france in his memoirs which were published in  after the suez crisis the united states became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the middle east via the eisenhower doctrine designed by secretary of state dulles it held the us would be prepared to use armed force to counter aggression from any country controlled by international communism further the united states would provide economic and military aid and if necessary use military force to stop the spread of communism in the middle east eisenhower applied the doctrine in by dispensing economic aid to shore up the kingdom of jordan and by encouraging syrias neighbors to consider military operations against it more dramatically in july he sent marines and soldiers to lebanon as part of operation blue bat a noncombat peacekeeping mission to stabilize the prowestern government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country the mission proved a success and the marines departed three months later the deployment came in response to the urgent request of lebanese president camille chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability weakened soviet influence and intimidated the egyptian and syrian governments whose antiwest political position had hardened after the suez crisis most arab countries were skeptical about the eisenhower doctrine because they considered zionist imperialism the real danger however they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons egypt and syria supported by the soviet union openly opposed the initiative however egypt received american aid until the six day war in  as the cold war deepened dulles sought to isolate the soviet union by building regional alliances of nations against it critics sometimes called it pactomania early in the french asked eisenhower for help in french indochina against the communists supplied from china who were fighting the first indochina war eisenhower sent lt general john w iron mike odaniel to vietnam to study and assess the french forces there chief of staff matthew ridgway dissuaded the president from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary eisenhower stated prophetically that this war would absorb our troops by divisions eisenhower did provide france with bombers and noncombat personnel after a few months with no success by the french he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes further requests for assistance from the french were agreed to but only on conditions eisenhower knew were impossible to meet allied participation and congressional approval when the french fortress of dien bien phu fell to the vietnamese communists in may eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the chairman of the joint chiefs the vice president and the head of ncs eisenhower responded to the french defeat with the formation of the seato southeast asia treaty organization alliance with the uk france new zealand and australia in defense of vietnam against communism at that time the french and chinese reconvened geneva peace talks eisenhower agreed the us would participate only as an observer after france and the communists agreed to a partition of vietnam eisenhower rejected the agreement offering military and economic aid to southern vietnam ambrose argues that eisenhower by not participating in the geneva agreement had kept the us out of vietnam nevertheless with the formation of seato he had in the end put the us back into the conflict in late gen j lawton collins was made ambassador to free vietnam the term south vietnam came into use in effectively elevating the country to sovereign status collins instructions were to support the leader ngo dinh diem in subverting communism by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign in february eisenhower dispatched the first american soldiers to vietnam as military advisors to diems army after diem announced the formation of the republic of vietnam rvn commonly known as south vietnam in october eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military economic and technical assistance in the years that followed eisenhower increased the number of us military advisors in south vietnam to men this was due to north vietnams support of uprisings in the south and concern the nation would fall in may diem then president of south vietnam made a state visit to the united states for ten days president eisenhower pledged his continued support and a parade was held in diems honor in new york city although diem was publicly praised in private secretary of state john foster dulles conceded that diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives after the election of november eisenhower in briefing with john f kennedy pointed out the communist threat in southeast asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration eisenhower told kennedy he considered laos the cork in the bottle with regard to the regional threat on may a us oneman u spy plane was reportedly shot down at high altitude over soviet union airspace the flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an eastwest summit conference which had been scheduled in paris days later captain francis gary powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto russian soil four days after powers disappeared the eisenhower administration had nasa issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had gone missing north of turkey it speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged and falsely claimed that the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties soviet premier nikita khrushchev announced that a spyplane had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot as a result the eisenhower administration thinking the pilot had died in the crash authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a weather research aircraft which had unintentionally strayed into soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed difficulties with his oxygen equipment while flying over turkey the soviets put captain powers on trial and displayed parts of the u which had been recovered almost fully intact the four power paris summit between president dwight eisenhower nikita khrushchev harold macmillan and charles de gaulle collapsed because of the incident eisenhower refused to accede to khrushchevs demands that he apologize therefore khrushchev would not take part in the summit up until this event eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the soviet union nuclear arms reduction and berlin were to have been discussed at the summit eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that stupid u business the affair was an embarrassment for united states prestige further the senate foreign relations committee held a lengthy inquiry into the u incident in russia captain powers made a forced confession and apology on august powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment on february powers was exchanged for rudolf abel in berlin and returned to the us while president truman had begun the process of desegregating the armed forces in actual implementation had been slow eisenhower made clear his stance in his first state of the union address in february saying i propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the president to end segregation in the district of columbia including the federal government and any segregation in the armed forces when he encountered opposition from the services he used government control of military spending to force the change through stating wherever federal funds are expended i do not see how any american can justify a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds when robert b anderson eisenhowers first secretary of the navy argued that the us navy must recognize the customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the navy had no part in creating eisenhower overruled him we have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step there must be no second class citizens in this country the administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue as communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the us as a point of propaganda attack eisenhower told district of columbia officials to make washington a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children he proposed to congress the civil rights act of and of and signed those acts into law the act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the justice department and a civil rights commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since  in the state of arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the brown decision eisenhower demanded that arkansas governor orval faubus obey the court order when faubus balked the president placed the arkansas national guard under federal control and sent in the st airborne division they escorted and protected nine black students entry to little rock central high school an allwhite public school for the first time since the reconstruction era martin luther king jr wrote to eisenhower to thank him for his actions writing the overwhelming majority of southerners negro and white stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in little rock eisenhower had a republican congress for only his first two years in office in the senate the republican majority was by a onevote margin senator robert a taft assisted the president greatly in working with the old guard and was sorely missed when his death in july left eisenhower with his successor william knowland whom eisenhower disliked this prevented eisenhower from openly condemning joseph mccarthys highly criticized methods against communism to facilitate relations with congress eisenhower decided to ignore mccarthys controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from involvement of the white house this position drew criticism from a number of corners in late mccarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the senate elections eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists nevertheless he refused among ikes objectives in not directly confronting mccarthy was to prevent mccarthy from dragging the atomic energy commission aec into mccarthys witch hunt for communists which would interfere with and perhaps delay the aecs important work on hbombs the administration had discovered through its own investigations that one of the leading scientists on the aec j robert oppenheimer had urged that the hbomb work be delayed eisenhower removed him from the agency and revoked his security clearance though he knew this would create fertile ground for mccarthy in may mccarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to white house personnel eisenhower was furious and issued an order as follows it is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the executive branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications or any documents or reproductions concerning such advice be disclosed this was an unprecedented step by eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege ikes denial of mccarthys access to his staff reduced mccarthys hearings to rants about trivial matters and contributed to his ultimate downfall in early the old guard put forward a constitutional amendment called the bricker amendment which would curtail international agreements by the chief executive such as the yalta agreements eisenhower opposed the measure the old guard agreed with eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises which the democrats opposed the president succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the aec the democrats gained a majority in both houses in the election eisenhower had to work with the democratic majority leader lyndon b johnson later us president in the senate and speaker sam rayburn in the house both from texas joe martin the republican speaker from to and again from to wrote that eisenhower never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill there were exceptions leonard w hall for example who as chairman of the republican national committee tried to open the administrations eyes to the political facts of life with occasional success however these exceptions were not enough to right the balance speaker martin concluded that eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with congress with results often the reverse of what he has desired because members of congress resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the white house without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them the chief wants this the administration never made use of many republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking eisenhower appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states whittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired stewart and harlan were conservative republicans while brennan was a democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism in selecting a chief justice eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as lawandorder conservatives noting privately that warren represents the kind of political economic and social thinking that i believe we need on the supreme court he has a national name for integrity uprightness and courage that again i believe we need on the court in the next few years warren led the court in a series of liberal decisions that revolutionized the role of the court in addition to his five supreme court appointments eisenhower appointed judges to the united states courts of appeals and judges to the united states district courts eisenhower began smoking cigarettes at west point often two or three packs a day eisenhower stated that he gave himself an order to stop cold turkey in march while at columbia he was probably the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office on september while vacationing in colorado he had a serious heart attack that required six weeks hospitalization during which time nixon dulles and sherman adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the president he was treated by dr paul dudley white a cardiologist with a national reputation who regularly informed the press of the presidents progress instead of eliminating him as a candidate for a second term as president his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery as a consequence of his heart attack eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm which was in turn the cause of a mild stroke on november this incident occurred during a cabinet meeting when eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to speak or move his right hand the stroke had caused an aphasia the president also suffered from crohns disease chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on june to treat the intestinal block surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine his scheduled meeting with indian prime minister jawaharlal nehru was postponed so he could recover from surgery at his farm in gettysburg pennsylvania he was still recovering from this operation during the suez crisis eisenhowers health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his dietary habits but he still indulged in alcohol during a visit to england he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on august however before dinner at chequers on the next day his doctor general howard snyder recalled eisenhower drank several ginandtonics and one or two gins on the rocks three or four wines with the dinner the last three years of eisenhowers second term in office were ones of relatively good health eventually after leaving the white house he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks a severe heart attack in august largely ended his participation in public affairs in august he began to show symptoms of cholecystitis for which he underwent surgery on december when his gallbladder was removed containing gallstones after eisenhowers death in see below an autopsy unexpectedly revealed an adrenal pheochromocytoma a benign adrenalinesecreting tumor that may have made the president more vulnerable to heart disease eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks in total from until his death the nd amendment to the us constitution was ratified in and it set term limits to the presidency of two terms it stipulated that harry s truman the incumbent at the time would not be affected by the amendment after he had been elected to his second presidential term in eisenhower became the first us president constitutionally prevented from running for reelection to the office having served the maximum two terms eisenhower was also the first outgoing president to come under the protection of the former presidents act two living former presidents herbert hoover and harry s truman left office before the act was passed under the act eisenhower was entitled to receive a lifetime pension stateprovided staff and a secret service detail in the election to choose his successor eisenhower endorsed his own vice president republican richard nixon against democrat john f kennedy he told friends i will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to kennedy he actively campaigned for nixon in the final days although he may have done nixon some harm when asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of nixons policy ideas he had adopted eisenhower joked if you give me a week i might think of one i dont remember kennedys campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials nixon narrowly lost to kennedy eisenhower who was the oldest president in history at that time then was succeeded by the youngest elected president as kennedy was  on january eisenhower gave his final televised address to the nation from the oval office in his farewell speech eisenhower raised the issue of the cold war and role of the us armed forces he described the cold war we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals and continued with a warning that we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the militaryindustrial complex he elaborated we recognize the imperative need for this development the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together because of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as general of the army before entering the office of president of the united states upon completion of his presidential term his commission was reactivated by congress and eisenhower again was commissioned a fivestar general in the united states army eisenhower retired to the place where he and mamie had spent much of their postwar time a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at gettysburg pennsylvania miles from his ancestral home in elizabethville dauphin county pennsylvania they also maintained a retirement home in palm desert california in the eisenhowers donated the gettysburg farm to the national park service in retirement eisenhower did not completely retreat from political life he flew to san antonio where he had been stationed years earlier to support john w goode the unsuccessful republican candidate against the democrat henry b gonzalez for texas th congressional district seat he addressed the republican national convention in san francisco and appeared with party nominee barry goldwater in a campaign commercial from his gettysburg retreat however his endorsement came somewhat reluctantly because goldwater had in the latter s criticized eisenhower as a dimestore new dealercitation needed on the morning of march at the age of eisenhower died in washington dc of congestive heart failure at walter reed army medical center the following day his body was moved to the washington national cathedrals bethlehem chapel where he lay in repose for hours on march his body was brought by caisson to the united states capitol where he lay in state in the capitol rotunda on march eisenhowers body was returned to the national cathedral where he was given an episcopal church funeral service that evening eisenhowers body was placed onto a train en route to abilene kansas the last time a funeral train has been used as part of funeral proceedings of an american presidentcitation needed his body arrived on april and was interred that day in a small chapel on the grounds of the eisenhower presidential library the presidents body was buried as a general of the army the family used an standard soldiers casket and dressed his body in his famous short green jacket the medals worn were the army distinguished service medal with three oak leaf clusters the navy distinguished service medal and the legion of merit eisenhower is buried alongside his son doud who died at age in his wife mamie was buried next to him after her death in  president richard nixon eulogized eisenhower saying some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations for eight years now dwight eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation and yet he remained through his final days the worlds most admired and respected man truly the first citizen of the world in the immediate years after eisenhower left office his reputation declined he was widely seen by critics as an inactive uninspiring golfplaying president compared to his vigorous young successor john f kennedy who was years his junior despite his unprecedented use of army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at central high school in little rock eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the u incident and the associated international embarrassment for the soviet unions perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the space race and for his failure to publicly oppose mccarthyism in particular eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend george marshall from attacks by joseph mccarthy though he privately deplored mccarthys tactics and claims those omissions were held against him during the liberal climate of the s and s since that time however eisenhowers reputation has risen recent surveys of historians since the s often rank eisenhower in the top of all us presidentscitation needed historian john lewis gaddis has summarized the turnaround in evaluations by historians historians long ago abandoned the view that eisenhowers was a failed presidency he did after all end the korean war without getting into any others he stabilized and did not escalate the sovietamerican rivalry he strengthened european alliances while withdrawing support from european colonialism he rescued the republican party from isolationism and mccarthyism he maintained prosperity balanced the budget promoted technological innovation facilitated if reluctantly the civil rights movement and warned in the most memorable farewell address since washingtons of a militaryindustrial complex that could endanger the nations liberties not until reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do although conservatism in politics was strong during the s and eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs an area in which the careermilitary president had more knowledge and pursued a handsoff domestic policy eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance although he sought to slow or contain the new deal and other federal programs he did not attempt to repeal them outright and in doing so was popular among the liberal wing of the republican party conservative critics of his administration found that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right according to hans morgenthau eisenhowers victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the republican party since the th century many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or gatekeeper sometimes described as the presidents private secretary sometimes with no official title at all eisenhower formalized this role introducing the office of white house chief of staff an idea he borrowed from the united states army every president after lyndon johnson has also appointed staff to this position initially gerald ford and jimmy carter tried to operate without a chief of staff but each eventually appointed one as president eisenhower also initiated the up or out policy in the us military whereby officers who are passed over for promotion twice are usually honorably discharged to make way for younger more able officers eisenhower never forgot his own frustration at being stuck at the rank of major for years between the two world warscitation needed on december eisenhower was appointed to the rank of general of the army placing him in the company of george marshall henry hap arnold and douglas macarthur the only four men to achieve the rank in world war two and along with omar bradley one of only five men to achieve the rank since the august death of philip sheridan and the only five men to hold the rank as a fivestar general the rank was created by an act of congress on a temporary basis when public law was passed on december as a temporary rank subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war the temporary rank was then declared permanent march by public law of the th congress which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list it was created to give the most senior american commanders parity of rank with their british counterparts holding the ranks of field marshal and admiral of the fleet this second general of the army rank is not the same as the postcivil war era version because of its purpose and five stars eisenhower founded people to people international in based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace the program includes a student ambassador component

mothers and fathers are going broke warren and tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflationadjusted income than a fully employed worker did years ago although families spend less today on clothing appliances and other consumption the costs of core expenses such as mortgages health care transportation and child care have increased dramatically the result is that even with two income earners families are no longer able to save and have incurred greater and greater debt in an article in the new york times jeff madrick said of warrens book the authors find that it is not the freespending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children their main thesis is undeniable typical families often cannot afford the highquality education health care and neighborhoods required to be middle class today more clearly than anyone else i think ms warren and ms tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way americans really live in warren and david himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills which found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem they say that threequarters of such families had medical insurance this study was widely cited in policy debates although some have challenged the studys methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses warrens book a fighting chance was published by metropolitan books in april according to a review published in the boston globe the books title refers to a time she says is now gone when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by

liaison office in the peoples republic of china since the united states at the time maintained official relations with the republic of china on taiwan and not the peoples republic of china the liaison office did not have the official status of an embassy and bush did not formally hold the position of ambassador though he unofficially acted as one the months that he spent in china were largely seen

bob dole of kansas congressman john anderson of illinois who would later run as an independent congressman phil crane also of illinois former governor john connally of texas former minnesota governor harold stassen and the frontrunner ronald reagan former actor and governor of california in the primary election bush focused almost entirely on the iowa caucuses while reagan ran a more traditional campaign bush represented the centrist wing in the gop whereas reagan represented conservatives bush famously labeled reagans supply sideinfluenced plans for massive tax cuts voodoo economics his strategy proved useful to some degree as he won in iowa with to reagans after the win bush stated that his campaign was full of momentum or big mo as a result of the loss reagan replaced his campaign manager reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary the two men agreed to a debate in the state organized by the nashua telegraph but paid for by the reagan campaign reagan invited the other four candidates as well but bush refused to debate them and eventually they left the debate proved to be a pivotal moment in the campaign when the moderator john breen ordered reagans microphone turned off his angry response i am paying for this microphone struck a chord with the public bush ended up losing new hampshires primary with to reagans bush lost most of the remaining primaries as well and formally dropped out of the race in may of that year with his political future seeming dismal bush sold his house in houston and bought his grandfathers estate in kennebunkport maine known as walkers point at the republican convention reagan selected bush as his vice presidential nominee placing him on the winning republican presidential ticket of  as vice president bush generally took on a low profile while recognizing the constitutional limits of the office he avoided decisionmaking or criticizing reagan in any way as had become customary he and his wife moved into the vice presidents residence at number one observatory circle about two miles from the white house after selling the house in the tanglewood the bushes declared a room in the houstonian hotel in houston as their official voting address the bushes attended a large number of public and ceremonial events in their positions including many state funerals which became a common joke for comedians mrs bush found the funerals largely beneficial saying george met with many current or future heads of state at the funerals he attended enabling him to forge personal relationships that were important to president reagan as the president of the senate bush stayed in contact with members of congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on capitol hill on march early into the administration reagan was shot and seriously wounded in washington dc bush second in command by the presidential line of succession was in fort worth texas and flew back to washington immediately reagans cabinet convened in the white house situation room where they discussed various issues including the availability of the nuclear football when bushs plane landed his aides advised him to proceed directly to the white house by helicopter as an image of the government still functioning despite the attack bush rejected the idea responding only the president lands on the south lawn this made a positive impression on reagan who recovered and returned to work within two weeks from then on the two men would have regular thursday lunches in the oval office in december bush flew to el salvador and warned that countrys military leaders to end their death squads and hold fully free elections or face the loss of us aid bushs aides feared for his safety and thought about calling the meeting off when they discovered apparent blood stains on the floor of the presidential palace of lvaro magaa bush was never told of the aides concerns and a tense meeting was held in which some of magaas personnel brandished semiautomatic weapons and refused requests to take them outside bush was assigned by reagan to chair two special task forces on deregulation and international drug smuggling the deregulation task force reviewed hundreds of rules making specific recommendations on which ones to amend or revise in order to curb the size of the federal government the drug smuggling task force coordinated federal efforts to reduce the quantity of drugs entering the united states both were popular issues with conservatives and bush largely a moderate began courting them through his work reagan and bush ran for reelection in the democratic opponent walter mondale made history by choosing a woman as his running mate new york representative geraldine ferraro she and bush squared off in a single televised vice presidential debate serving as a contrast to the ivyleague educated bush ferraro represented a bluecollar district in queens new york this coupled with her popularity among female journalists left bush at a disadvantage the reaganbush ticket won in a landslide against the mondaleferraro ticket early into his second term as vice president bush and his aides were planning a run for the presidency in by the end of a committee had been established and over two million dollars raised for bush bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when on july reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon making bush acting president for approximately eight hours the reagan administration was shaken by a scandal in when it was revealed that administration officials had secretly arranged weapon sales to iran and had used the proceeds to fund the anticommunist contras in nicaragua a direct violation of the law when the irancontra affair as it became known broke to the media bush like reagan stated that he had been out of the loop and unaware of the diversion of funds although this was later questioned his diaries from that time stated im one of the few people that know fully the details ailes and others were concerned that bush was seen as a wimp an image put to rest by his evident fury in an interview with dan rather as vice president bush officially opened the pan american games in indianapolis in the uss vincennes accidentally shot down iran air flight killing passengers bush said that he would never apologize for the united states of america ever i dont care what the facts are in the january issue of time magazine in an article entitled where is the real george bush journalist robert ajemian reported that a friend of bushs had urged him to spend several days at camp david thinking through his plans for his prospective presidency to which bush is said to have responded in exasperation oh the vision thing this oftcited quote became a shorthand for the charge that bush failed to contemplate or articulate important policy positions in a compelling and coherent manner the phrase has since become a metonym for any politicians failure to incorporate a greater vision in a campaign and has often been applied in the media to other politicians or public figures bush had been planning a presidential run since as early as and entered the republican primary for president of the united states in october his challengers for the republican presidential nomination included us senator bob dole of kansas us representative jack kemp of new york former governor pete dupont of delaware and conservative christian televangelist pat robertson though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination bush came in third in the iowa caucus behind winner dole and runnerup robertson much as reagan did in bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the new hampshire primary with dole ahead in new hampshire bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser he rebounded to win the states primary following the primary bush and dole had a joint media appearance when the interviewer asked dole if he had anything to say to bush dole said in response to the ads yeah stop lying about my record in an angry tone this is thought to have hurt doles campaign to bushs benefit bush continued seeing victory winning many southern primaries as well once the multiplestate primaries such as super tuesday began bushs organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match and the nomination was his leading up to the republican national convention there was much speculation as to bushs choice of running mate bush chose littleknown us senator dan quayle of indiana favored by conservatives despite reagans popularity bush trailed democratic nominee michael dukakis then governor of massachusetts in most polls bush occasionally criticized for his lack of eloquence when compared to reagan delivered a wellreceived speech at the republican national convention known as the thousand points of light speech it described bushs vision of america he endorsed the pledge of allegiance prayer in schools capital punishment gun rights and opposed abortion the speech at the convention included bushs famous pledge read my lips no new taxes the general election campaign between the two men was described in as one of the dirtiest in modern times bush blamed dukakis for polluting the boston harbor as the massachusetts governor bush also pointed out that dukakis was opposed to a law that would require all students to say the pledge of allegiance a topic well covered in bushs nomination acceptance speech dukakiss unconditional opposition to capital punishment led to a pointed question being asked during the presidential debates moderator bernard shaw asked dukakis if dukakis would hypothetically support the death penalty if his wife kitty were raped and murdered dukakiss response of no as well as a provocative ad about convicted felon willie horton contributed toward bushs characterization of dukakis as soft on crime bush defeated dukakis and his running mate lloyd bentsen in the electoral college by to bentsen received one vote from a faithless elector in the

the budget with republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending and democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes bush faced problems when it came to consensus building in the wake of a struggle with congress bush was forced by the democratic majority to raise tax revenues as a result many republicans felt betrayed because bush had promised no new taxes in his campaign perceiving a means of revenge republican congressmen defeated bushs proposal which would enact spending cuts and tax increases that would reduce the deficit by billion over five years

democraticallycontrolled senate judiciary committee in the s panamanian leader manuel noriega a once ussupportive leader who was later accused of spying for fidel castro and using panama to traffic drugs into the united states was one of the most recognizable names in america and was constantly in the press the struggle to remove him from power began in the reagan administration when economic sanctions were imposed on the country this included prohibiting american companies and government from making payments to panama and freezing million in panamanian funds in american banks reagan sent more than american troops to panama as well unlike reagan bush was able to remove noriega from power but his administrations unsuccessful postinvasion planning hindered the needs of panama during the establishment of the young democratic government in may panama held democratic elections in which guillermo endara was elected president the results were then annulled by noriegas government in response bush sent more troops to the country where they began conducting regular military exercises in panamanian territory in violation of prior treaties bush then removed an embassy and ambassador from the country and dispatched additional troops to panama to prepare the way for an upcoming invasion noriega suppressed an october military coup attempt and massive protests in panama against him but after a us serviceman was shot by panamanian forces in december bush ordered troops into the country with an objective of removing noriega from power operation just cause was a largescale american military operation and the first in more than years that was not related to the cold war the mission was controversial but american forces achieved control of the country and endara assumed the presidency noriega surrendered to the united states and was convicted and imprisoned on racketeering and drug trafficking charges in april president bush and first lady barbara bush visited panama in june to give support to the first postinvasion panamanian government in just after the fall of the berlin wall bush met with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev in a conference on the mediterranean island of malta the administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the soviets but not all initially found the malta summit to be a step in the right direction general brent scowcroft among others was apprehensive about the meeting saying that it might be premature due to concerns where according to condoleezza rice expectations would be set that something was going to happen where the soviets might grandstand and force the us into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the united states but european leaders including franois mitterrand and margaret thatcher encouraged bush to meet with gorbachev something that he did december and though no agreements were signed the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one when asked about nuclear war gorbachev responded i assured the president of the united states that the soviet union would never start a hot war against the united states of america and we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation this is just the beginning we are just at the very beginning of our road long road to a longlasting peaceful period the meeting was received as a very important step to the end of the cold war another summit was held in july where the strategic arms reduction treaty start i was signed by bush and gorbachev in moscow the treaty took nine years in the making and was the first major arms agreement since the signing of the intermediate ranged nuclear forces treaty by reagan and gorbachev in the contentions in start would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of the united states and the ussr by about over seven years and the soviet unions landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles would be cut by bush described start as a significant step forward in dispelling half a century of mistrust after the dissolution of the ussr in president bush and gorbachev declared a usrussian strategic partnership marking the end of the cold war on august iraq led by saddam hussein invaded its oilrich neighbor to the south kuwait bush condemned the invasion and began rallying opposition to iraq in the us and among european asian and middle eastern allies secretary of defense richard bruce dick cheney traveled to saudi arabia to meet with king fahd fahd requested us military aid in the matter fearing a possible invasion of his country as well the request was met initially with air force fighter jets iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal that would allow the country to take control of half of kuwait bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of iraqi forces the planning of a ground operation by usled coalition forces began forming in september headed by general norman schwarzkopf bush spoke before a joint session of the us congress regarding the authorization of air and land attacks laying out four immediate objectives iraq must withdraw from kuwait completely immediately and without condition kuwaits legitimate government must be restored the security and stability of the persian gulf must be assured and american citizens abroad must be protected he then outlined a fifth longterm objective out of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order can emerge a new era freer from the threat of terror stronger in the pursuit of justice and more secure in the quest for peace an era in which the nations of the world east and west north and south can prosper and live in harmony a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak with the united nations security council opposed to iraqs violence congress authorized the use of military force with a set goal of returning control of kuwait to the kuwaiti government and protecting americas interests abroad early on the morning of january allied forces launched the first attack which included more than bombing runs by coalition aircraft this pace would continue for the next four weeks until a ground invasion was launched on february allied forces penetrated iraqi lines and pushed toward kuwait city while on the west side of the country forces were intercepting the retreating iraqi army bush made the decision to stop the offensive after a mere hours critics labeled this decision premature as hundreds of iraqi forces were able to escape bush responded by saying that he wanted to minimize us casualties opponents further charged that bush should have continued the attack pushing husseins army back to baghdad then removing him from power bush explained that he did not give the order to overthrow the iraqi government because it would have incurred incalculable human and political costs we would have been forced to occupy baghdad and in effect rule iraq bushs approval ratings skyrocketed after the successful offensive additionally president bush and secretary of state baker felt the coalition victory had increased us prestige abroad and believed there was a window of opportunity to use the political capital generated by the coalition victory to revitalize the arabisraeli peace process the administration immediately returned to arabisraeli peacemaking following the end of the gulf war this resulted in the madrid conference later in  faced with a humanitarian disaster in somalia exacerbated by a complete breakdown in civil order the united nations had created the unosom i mission in april to aid the situation through humanitarian efforts though the mission failed the bush administration proposed american aid to the region by assisting in creating a secure environment for humanitarian efforts and un resolution was unanimously adopted by the security council on december a lame duck president bush launched operation restore hope the following day under which the united states would assume command in accordance with resolution fighting would escalate and continue into the clinton administration bushs administration along with the progressive conservative canadian prime minister brian mulroney spearheaded the negotiations of the north american free trade agreement nafta which would eliminate the majority of tariffs on products traded among the united states canada and mexico to encourage trade amongst the countries the treaty also restricts patents copyrights and trademarks and outlines the removal of investment restrictions among the three countries the agreement came under heavy scrutiny amongst mainly democrats who charged that nafta resulted in a loss of american jobs nafta also contained no provisions for labor rights according to the bush administration the trade agreement would generate economic resources necessary to enable mexicos government to overcome problems of funding and enforcement of its labor laws bush needed a renewal of negotiating authority to move forward with the nafta trade talks such authority would enable the president to negotiate a trade accord that would be submitted to congress for a vote thereby avoiding a situation in which the president would be required to renegotiate with trading partners those parts of an agreement that congress wished to change while initial signing was possible during his term negotiations made slow but steady progress president clinton would go on to make the passage of nafta a priority for his administration despite its conservative and republican rootswith the addition of two side agreementsto achieve its passage in  the treaty has since been defended as well as criticized further the american economy has grown since the adoption of nafta in with million new jobs created this was seen by some as evidence of nafta being beneficial to the united states with talk in early regarding a possible american withdrawal from the treaty carlos m gutierrez current united states secretary of commerce writes quitting nafta would send economic shock waves throughout the world and the damage would start here at home but john j sweeney president of the aflcio wrote in the boston globe that the us trade deficit with canada and mexico ballooned to times its prenafta size reaching billion in  on january bush fainted after vomiting at a banquet hosted by the then prime minister of japan

foundation awarded bush its lone sailor award for his naval service and his subsequent government service in he was made an honorary knight grand cross of the order of the bath by queen elizabeth ii bush announced his reelection bid in early with a coalition victory in the persian gulf war and high approval ratings reelection initially looked likely as a result many leading democrats declined to seek their partys presidential nomination but an economic recession and doubts of whether bush ended the gulf war properly reduced his popularity conservative political columnist pat buchanan challenged bush for the republican nomination and shocked political pundits by finishing second with of the vote in the new hampshire primary bush responded by adopting more conservative positions on issues in an attempt to undermine buchanans base once he had secured the nomination bush faced his challenger democrat and governor of arkansas william jefferson bill clinton clinton attacked bush as not doing enough to assist the working middleclass and being out of touch with the common man a notion reinforced by reporter andrew rosenthals false report that bush was astonished to see a demonstration of a supermarket scanner in early the race took an unexpected twist when texas billionaire h ross perot launched a third party bid claiming that neither republicans nor democrats could eliminate the deficit and make government more efficient his message appealed to voters across the political spectrum disappointed with both parties perceived fiscal irresponsibility perot later bowed out of the race for a short time then reentered clinton had originally been in the lead until perot reentered tightening the race significantly nearing election day polls suggested that the race was a deadheat but clinton pulled out on top defeating bush in a to popular vote margin perot won of the popular vote one of the highest totals for a third party candidate in us history drawing equally from both major candidates according to exit polls bush received electoral votes to clintons  several factors were key in bushs defeat the ailing economy which arose from recession may have been the main factor in bushs loss as in voters said on election day that the economy was either not so good or poor on the eve of the election after unemployment reports of appeared the highest since economic recession had contributed to a sharp decline in his approval rating to just  conservative republicans point to bushs agreement to raise taxes in contradiction of his famous read my lips no new taxes pledge in doing so bush alienated many members of his conservative base losing their support for his reelection according to one survey of the voters who cited bushs broken no new taxes pledge as very important two thirds voted for bill clinton bush had raised taxes in an attempt to address an increasing budget deficit which has largely been attributed to the reagan tax cuts and military spending of the s the tax revenue increase had not hurt his approval ratings to the extent that it prevented it from reaching during the gulf war four months after the tax vote by february his approval rating rose to its highest level george bush was widely seen as a pragmatic caretaker president who lacked a unified and compelling longterm theme in his efforts indeed bushs sound bite where he refers to the issue of overarching purpose as the vision thing has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties he does not say why he wants to be there wrote columnist george will so the public does not know why it should care if he gets his way his ivy league and prep school education led to warnings by advisors that his image was too preppy in which resulted in deliberate efforts in his campaign to shed the image including meeting voters at factories and shopping malls abandoning set speeches his ability to gain broad international support for the gulf war and the wars result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph rousing bipartisan approval though his decision to withdraw without removing saddam hussein left mixed feelings and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy a new york times article mistakenly depicted bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was out of touch amid the early s recession his image shifted from conquering hero to politician befuddled by economic matters although bush became the first elected republican president since hoover in to lose a reelection bid facing a approval rating leading up to the election the mood did not last despite his defeat bush climbed back from election day approval levels to leave office in with a job approval rating by december of americans gave bushs presidency a positive rating upon leaving office bush retired with his wife barbara and temporarily moved into a friends

in a way race pataki served in the senate of the th new york state legislature and ran for governor at the next election pataki was a first term state senator from westchester county when he launched

chairman richard rosenbaum in the september primary pataki was considered an underdog from the start since he was running against three term gov mario cuomo and because pataki had little name recognition statewide damato reportedly backed pataki because of a poll that showed a prochoice fiscal conservative from the new york city suburbs could win statewide for governor the poll also showed a female running mate for lieutenant governor would help the ticket thus leading to the selection of academic betsy mccaughey as patakis running mate the polls had governor cuomo up by as much as ten

unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers saying the surplus is not the governments money the surplus is the peoples money federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned of a recession and bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs treasury secretary paul h oneill opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine social security oneill disputes the claim made in bushs book decision points that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts by the economy showed signs of improvement though job growth remained stagnant another tax cut program was passed that year during the to years gdp grew at an average annual rate of percent less than for past business cycles bush entered office with the dow jones industrial average at and the average peaked in october at over when bush left office the average was at one of the lowest levels of his presidency unemployment originally rose from percent in january to percent in june but subsequently dropped to percent as of july adjusted for inflation median household income dropped by between and while professor ken homa of georgetown university has noted that median real aftertax household income went up the poverty rate increased from percent in to percent in after peaking at percent in by october due to increases in spending the national debt had risen to trillion an increase of over percent from when the debt was only trillion most debt was accumulated as a result of what became known as the bush tax cuts and increased national security spending in march thensenator barack obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling the fact that we are here today to debate raising americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure by the end of bushs presidency unemployment climbed to percent in december the united states entered the longest postworld war ii recession which included a housing market correction a subprime mortgage crisis soaring oil prices and a declining dollar value in february jobs were lost a fiveyear record to aid with the situation bush signed a billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses the bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac in and after two years the regulations passed the house but died in the senate many republican senators as well as influential members of the bush administration feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sectors risky practices in september the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac followed by the collapse of lehman brothers and a federal bailout of american international group for billion many economists and world governments determined that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the great depression additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the us mortgage market vince reinhardt a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute said it would have helped for the bush administration to empower the folks at treasury and the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the fdic to look at these issues more closely and additionally that it would have helped for congress to have held hearings in november over jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the united states in years the bureau of labor statistics reported that in the last four months of million jobs were lost by the end of the us had lost a total of million jobs bush undertook a number of educational priorities such as increasing the funding for the national science foundation and national institutes of health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for american high school students funding for the nih was cut in the first such cut in years due to rising inflation one of the administrations early major initiatives was the no child left behind act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in lowperforming schools and target more federal funding to lowincome schools this landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of senator ted kennedy of massachusetts it was signed into law by bush in early many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the us have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed no child left behind into law critics argue that it is underfunded and that nclbas focus on highstakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductive after being reelected bush signed into law a medicare drug benefit program that according to jan crawford resulted in the greatest expansion in americas welfare state in forty years the bills costs approached trillion in bush opposed and vetoed state childrens health insurance program schip legislation which was added by the democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by congress the schip legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some lowincome families from about sixmillion to tenmillion children it was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as per year who did not need the help following republican efforts to pass the medicare act of bush signed the bill which included major changes to the medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits the retired persons lobby group aarp worked with the bush administration on the program and gave their endorsement bush said the law estimated to cost billion over the first ten years would give the elderly better choices and more control over their health care bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform social security which was facing record deficit projections beginning in bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the us congress in his state of the union address bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax fica into secured investments democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system bush embarked on a day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as conversations on social security in an attempt to gain public support nevertheless public support for the proposal declined and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their legislative agenda the proposals legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from hurricane katrina in the fall of after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in office upon taking office in bush stated his opposition to the kyoto protocol an amendment to the united nations framework convention on climate change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted percent of the worlds population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year he also cited that the senate had voted in on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol in may bush signed an executive order to create an interagency task force to streamline energy projects and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issues in bush announced the clear skies act of aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committee later in bush declared the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahnaumokukea marine national monument comprises million acres km and is home to species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands the move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area bush has said that he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a debate over whether its manmade or naturally caused the bush administrations stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming in his state of the union address bush declared america is addicted to oil and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase energy development research in his state of the union address bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production amid high gasoline prices in bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling however the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the us congress bush had said in june in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gassaving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil production in his state of the union address bush announced that the us would commit billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying along with contributions from other countries this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner more efficient technologies in developing nations like india and china and help leverage substantial privatesector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive he also announced plans to reaffirm the united states commitment to work with major economies and through the un to complete an international agreement that will slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases he stated this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health has been forbidden by law since the passage in of the dickeywicker amendment by congress and the signature of president bill clinton bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research however bush did not support embryonic stem cell research on august bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the existing lines of stem cells but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines on july bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickeywicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo on may president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina the bill aims to protect americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment the issue had been debated for years before becoming law it is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research nearly million immigrants came to the united states from to more than in any other fiveyear period in the nations history almost half entered illegally in bush urged congress to allow more than million illegal immigrants to work in the united states with the creation of a temporary guestworker program bush also urged congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying national guard troops to the mexicounited states border from may to june bush strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform act of which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the bush administration the bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants with an eventual path to citizenship establishing a guest worker program a series of border and work site enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a pointbased merit system for green cards elimination of chain migration and of the diversity immigrant visa and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of us laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty a heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june when a cloture motion failed on a vote bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives the bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law on september former israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that bush offered to accept palestinian refugees as american citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between israel and the palestinian authority hurricane katrina one of the most damaging natural disasters in us history struck early in bushs second term katrina formed in late august during the atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the northcentral gulf coast of the united states particularly new orleans bush declared a state of emergency in louisiana on august and in mississippi and alabama the following day he authorized the department of homeland security dhs and federal emergency management agency fema to manage the disaster but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action the eye of the hurricane made landfall on august and new orleans began to flood due to levee breaches later that day bush declared that a major disaster existed in louisiana officially authorizing fema to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery effort on august dhs secretary michael chertoff declared it an incident of national significance triggering the first use of the newly created national response plan three days later on september national guard troops first entered the city of new orleans the same day bush toured parts of louisiana mississippi and alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was not enough as the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administrations role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal governments failures in its handling of the emergency it has been argued that with katrina bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover during bushs second term a controversy arose over the justice departments midterm dismissal of seven united states attorneys the white house maintained that the us attorneys were fired for poor performance attorney general alberto gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the justice department the house judiciary committee issued subpoenas for advisers harriet miers and josh bolten to testify regarding this matter but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice the justice department determined that the presidents order was legal although congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the us attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released on march the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas on july a united states district court judge ruled that bushs top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenas in all twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress they included attorney general alberto gonzales and his chief of staff kyle sampson gonzales liaison to the white house monica goodling aide to the president karl rove and his senior aide sara taylor in addition legal counsel to the president harriet miers and deputy chief of staff to the president joshua bolten were both found in contempt of congress in the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal according to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offense in july bush visited pope john paul ii at castel gandolfo during his presidential campaign bushs foreign policy platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with latin america especially mexico and a reduction of involvement in nationbuilding and other smallscale military engagements the administration pursued a national missile defense bush was an advocate of chinas entry into the world trade organization in his state of the union address bush referred to an axis of evil including iraq iran and north korea after the september attacks on new york bush launched the war on terror in which the united states military and a small international coalition invaded afghanistan in bush then launched the invasion of iraq searching for weapons of mass destruction which he described as being part of the war on terrorism those invasions led to the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan and the removal of saddam hussein from power in iraq bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with european nations he appointed longtime adviser karen hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign bush lauded the prodemocracy struggles in georgia and ukrainecitation needed in march a visit to india led to renewed ties between the two countries reversing decades of us policy the visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counterterrorism cooperation discussions that would lead eventually to the indiaunited states civil nuclear agreement this is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor clinton whose approach and response to india after the nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bushs tenure midway through bushs second term it was questioned whether bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda highlighted in policy changes toward some oilrich former soviet republics in central asia in an address before both houses of congress on september bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the september attacks he specifically thanked uk prime minister tony blair for traveling to washington to show unity of purpose with america and said america has no truer friend than great britain the september terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bushs presidency that evening he addressed the nation from the oval office promising a strong response to the attacks he also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims on september he visited ground zero meeting with mayor rudy giuliani firefighters police officers and volunteers bush addressed the gathering via a megaphone while standing on a heap of rubble to much applause i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon in a september speech bush condemned osama bin laden and his organization alqaeda and issued an ultimatum to the taliban regime in afghanistan where bin laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or share in their fate after september bush announced a global war on terror the afghan taliban regime was not forthcoming with osama bin laden so bush ordered the invasion of afghanistan to overthrow the taliban regime in his january state of the union address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of north korea iran and iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and posed a grave and growing danger the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war this became the basis for the bush doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september attacks dissent and criticism of bushs leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in iraq continued in a national intelligence estimate concluded that the iraq war had become the cause clbre for jihadists on october us and british forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of northern alliance troops in kabul on november the main goals of the war were to defeat the taliban drive alqaeda out of afghanistan and capture key alqaeda leaders in december the pentagon reported that the taliban had been defeated but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening taliban and alqaeda leaders later that month the un had installed the afghan transitional administration chaired by hamid karzai in based on unicef figures nicholas kristof reported that our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aid efforts to kill or capture alqaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december in the mountainous region of tora bora which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough us ground troops it was not until may two years after bush left office that bin laden was killed by us forces bin ladens successor ayman alzawahiri remains at large despite the initial success in driving the taliban from power in kabul by early the taliban was regrouping amassing new funds and recruits the failure of operation red wings showed that the taliban had returned in the taliban insurgency appeared larger fiercer and better organized than expected with largescale allied offensives such as operation mountain thrust attaining limited success as a result bush commissioned additional troops to the country in march  beginning with his january state of the union address bush began publicly focusing attention on iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to us interests through possession of weapons of mass destruction in the latter half of cia reports contained assertions of saddam husseins intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president in late and early bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis in november hans blix and mohamed elbaradei led un weapons inspectors in iraq but were advised by the us to depart the country four days prior to the us invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks the us initially sought a un security council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for un approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries more than nations most notably the united kingdom designated the coalition of the willing joined the united states in invading iraq they launched the invasion on march the iraqi military was quickly defeated the capital baghdad fell on april on may bush declared the end of major combat operations in iraq the initial success of us operations increased his popularity but the us and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups bushs mission accomplished speech was later criticized as premature from until the situation in iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a fullscale civil war in iraq bushs policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from iraq the report of the bipartisan iraq study group led by james baker concluded that the situation in iraq was grave and deteriorating while bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of iraq he maintained he would not change the overall iraq strategy in january free democratic elections were held in iraq for the first time in years according to iraqi national security advisor mowaffak alrubaie this is the greatest day in the history of this country bush praised the event as well saying that the iraqis have taken rightful control of their countrys destiny this led to the election of jalal talabani as president and nouri almaliki as prime minister of iraq a referendum to approve a constitution in iraq was held in october supported by most shiites and many kurds on january bush announced a surge of more troops for iraq as well as a job program for iraqis more reconstruction proposals and billion for these programs on may bush used his secondever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of us troops saying the debate over the conflict was understandable but insisting that a continued us presence there was crucial in march bush praised the iraqi governments bold decision to launch the battle of basra against the mahdi army calling it a defining moment in the history of a free iraq he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of he also praised the iraqis legislative achievements including a pension law a revised debaathification law a new budget an amnesty law and a provincial powers measure that he said set the stage for the iraqi elections by july american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began and due to increased stability in iraq bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forces following the events of september bush issued an executive order authorizing the presidents surveillance program which included allowing the nsa to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the us and parties within the us without obtaining a warrant as required by the foreign intelligence surveillance act as of the other provisions of the program remained highly classified once the department of justice office of legal counsel questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently reauthorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the authorization for use of military force against terrorists the program proved to be controversial as critics of the administration as well as organizations such as the american bar association argued that it was illegal in august a us district court judge ruled that the nsa electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional but on july that ruling was vacated by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing on january attorney general alberto gonzales informed us senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the president but would be subjected to judicial oversight later in the nsa launched a replacement for the program referred to as prism that was subject to the oversight of the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court this program was not publicly revealed until reports by the washington post and the guardian emerged in june  bush authorized the cia to use waterboarding as one of several enhanced interrogation techniques between and the cia considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be legal based on a secret justice department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the geneva conventions ban on torture and vice president cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal the cia had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the bybee memo from the attorney general though that memo was later withdrawn while not permitted by the us army field manuals which assert that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations provided critical information to preserve american lives critics such as former cia officer bob baer have stated that information was suspect you can get anyone to confess to anything if the tortures bad enough on october bush signed into law the military commissions act of a law enacted in the wake of the supreme courts decision in hamdan v rumsfeld us which allows the us government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial the law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture on march bush vetoed hr a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the united states army field manual on human intelligence collector operations saying that the bill congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror in april the aclu sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the bush administrations interrogation tactics one memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the cia was far more intense than authorized by the justice department bush publicly condemned kim jongil of north korea naming north korea one of three states in an axis of evil and saying that the united states of america will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons within months both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the usdprk agreed framework of october north koreas october detonation of a nuclear device further complicated bushs foreign policy which centered for both terms of his presidency on preventing the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world bush condemned north koreas position reaffirmed his commitment to a nuclearfree korean peninsula and stated that transfer of nuclear weapons or material by north korea to states or nonstate entities would be considered a grave threat to the united states for which north korea would be held accountable on may north korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account this was a result of a series of threeway talks initiated by the united states and including china on september north korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its nuclear programs by the end of by may north korea had restarted its nuclear program and threatened to attack south korea on june while south korea prospers the people of north korea have suffered profoundly he said adding that communism had resulted in dire poverty mass starvation and brutal suppression in recent years he went on to say the suffering has been compounded by the leader who wasted north koreas precious few resources on personal luxuries and nuclear weapons programs bush expanded economic sanctions on syria in early the treasury department acting on a june executive order froze american bank accounts of syrias higher institute of applied science and technology electronics institute and national standards and calibration laboratory bushs order prohibits americans from doing business with these institutions suspected of helping spread weapons of mass destruction and being supportive

outset judicature magazine noted that the senate democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings before the first set of nominees were sent to the senate it then cites the new york

nominations by october in february the democrats successfully filibustered the nomination of miguel estrada bushs upbringing in west texas his accent his vacations on his texas ranch and his penchant for country metaphors contribute to his folksy american cowboy image i think people look at him and think john wayne said piers morgan editor of the british daily mirror it has been suggested that bushs accent was an active choice as a way of distinguishing himself from northeastern intellectuals and anchoring himself to his texas roots both supporters and detractors have pointed to his country persona as reasons for their support or criticism bush has been parodied by the media comedians and other politicians detractors tended to cite linguistic errors made by bush during his public speeches which are colloquially referred to as bushisms some pundits labeled bush the worst president ever in contrast to his father who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme bush embraced larger visions and was seen as a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks tony blair wrote in that the caricature of bush as being dumb is ludicrous and that bush is very

the year a title awarded to someone who the editors believe has done the most to influence the events of the year in may gallup reported that percent of the republican electorate approved of bush

democratic rival john kerry according to peter feaver a duke university political scientist who has studied the political leanings of the us military members of the armed services supported bush

closely contested election ford was chosen to replace charles halleck of indiana as minority leader in january the republicans had seats in the house compared with the seats held by the democrats with that large majority and a majority in the us senate the johnson administration proposed and passed a series of programs that was called by johnson the great society during the first session of the eightyninth congress alone the johnson administration submitted bills to congress and johnson signed or arguably the most successful legislative agenda in congressional history in criticism over the johnson administrations handling of the vietnam war began to grow with ford and congressional republicans expressing concern that the united states was not doing what was necessary to win the war public sentiment also began to move against johnson and the midterm elections saw a seat swing in favor of the republicans this was not enough to give republicans a majority in the house but the victory gave ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further great society programs fords private criticism of the vietnam war became public following a speech from the floor of the house in which he questioned whether the white house had a clear plan to bring the war to a successful conclusion the speech angered president johnson who accused ford of playing too much football without a helmet as minority leader in the house ford appeared in a popular series of televised press conferences with illinois senator everett dirksen in which they proposed republican alternatives to johnsons policies many in the press jokingly called this the ev and jerry show johnson said at the time jerry ford is so dumb he cant fart and chew gum at the same time the press used to sanitizing lbjs salty language reported this as gerald ford cant walk and chew gum at the same time after president nixon was elected in november fords role shifted to being an advocate for the white house agenda congress passed several of nixons proposals including the national environmental policy act and the tax reform act of another highprofile victory for the republican minority was the state and local fiscal assistance act passed in the act established a revenue sharing program for state and local governments fords leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through congress and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with votes in favor compared with against during the eight years that ford served as minority leader he won many friends in the house because of his fair leadership and inoffensive personality on october vice president spiro agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme in which he accepted in bribes while governor of maryland according to the new york times nixon sought advice from senior congressional leaders about a replacement the advice was unanimous we gave nixon no choice but ford house speaker carl albert recalled later ford was nominated to take agnews position on october the first time the vicepresidential vacancy provision of the th amendment had been implemented the united states senate voted to to confirm ford on november only three senators all democrats voted against fords confirmation gaylord nelson of wisconsin thomas eagleton of missouri and william hathaway of maine on december the house confirmed ford by a vote of to one hour after the confirmation vote in the house ford took the oath of office as vice president of the united states ford became vice president as the watergate scandal was unfolding on thursday august chief of staff alexander haig contacted ford to tell him that smoking gun evidence had been found the evidence left little doubt that president nixon had been a part of the watergate coverup at the time ford and his wife betty were living in suburban virginia waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice presidents residence in washington dc however al haig asked to come over and see me ford later said to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a monday and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation and he said im just warning you that youve got to be prepared that things might change dramatically and you could become president and i said betty i dont think were ever going to live in the vice presidents house when nixon resigned on august ford assumed the presidency making him the only person to assume the presidency without having been previously voted into either the presidential or vice presidential office immediately after taking the oath of office in the east room of the white house he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation ford noted the peculiarity of his position i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots and so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers he went on to state i have not sought this enormous responsibility but i will not shirk it those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends they were of both parties elected by all the people and acting under the constitution in their name it is only fitting then that i should pledge to them and to you that i will be the president of all the people he also stated my fellow americans our long national nightmare is over our constitution works our great republic is a government of laws and not of men here the people rule but there is a higher power by whatever name we honor him who ordains not only righteousness but love not only justice but mercy let us restore the golden rule to our political process and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and hate a portion of the speech would later be memorialized with a plaque at the entrance to his presidential museum on august ford nominated former new york governor nelson rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated rockefellers top competitor had been george h w bush rockefeller underwent extended hearings before congress which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides such as henry kissinger although conservative republicans were not pleased that rockefeller was picked most of them voted for his confirmation and his nomination passed both the house and senate some including barry goldwater voted against him on september ford issued proclamation which gave nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he might have committed against the united states while president in a televised broadcast to the nation ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the nixon familys situation is a tragedy in which we all have played a part it could go on and on and on or someone must write the end to it i have concluded that only i can do that and if i can i must the nixon pardon was highly controversial critics derided the move and said a corrupt bargain had been struck between the men they said that fords pardon was granted in exchange for nixons resignation which had elevated ford to the presidency fords first press secretary and close friend jerald terhorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon according to bob woodward nixon chief of staff alexander haig proposed a pardon deal to ford he later decided to pardon nixon for other reasons primarily the friendship he and nixon shared regardless historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons ford lost the election in an observation with which ford agreed in an editorial at the time the new york times stated that the nixon pardon was a profoundly unwise divisive and unjust act that in a stroke had destroyed the new presidents credibility as a man of judgment candor and competence on october ford testified before congress on the pardon he was the first sitting president since abraham lincoln to testify before the house of representatives  in the months following the pardon ford often declined to mention president nixon by name referring to him in public as my predecessor or the former president when on a trip to california white house correspondent fred barnes pressed ford on the matter ford replied in surprisingly frank manner i just cant bring myself to do it after ford left the white house in january the former president privately justified his pardon of nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of burdick v united states a us supreme court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt in the john f kennedy library foundation awarded the john f kennedy profile in courage award to ford for his pardon of nixon in presenting the award to ford senator ted kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon of nixon but later decided that history had proved ford to have made the correct decision on september shortly after he announced the nixon pardon ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for vietnam war draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as canada and for military deserters in presidential proclamation the conditions of the amnesty required that those reaffirm their allegiance to the united states and serve two years working in a public service job or a total of two years service for those who had served less than two years of honorable service in the military the program for the return of vietnam era draft evaders and military deserters established a clemency board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a presidential pardon and a change in military discharge status full pardon for draft dodgers came in the carter administration upon assuming office ford inherited nixons cabinet during fords brief administration all members were replaced except secretary of state kissinger and secretary of the treasury william e simon fords dramatic reorganization of his cabinet in the fall of has been referred to by political commentators as the halloween massacre one of fords appointees william coleman as secretary of transportation was the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet after robert c weaver and the first appointed in a republican administration other cabinetlevel posts other important posts ford selected george hw bush as chief of the us liaison office to the peoples republic of china in and then director of the central intelligence agency in late  fords transition chairman and first chief of staff was former congressman and ambassador donald rumsfeld in rumsfeld was named by ford as the youngestever secretary of defense ford chose a young wyoming politician richard cheney to replace rumsfeld as his new chief of staff cheney became the campaign manager for fords presidential campaign the congressional midterm elections took place less than three months after ford assumed office and in the wake of the watergate scandal the democratic party turned voter dissatisfaction into large gains in the house elections taking seats from the republican party increasing their majority to of the seats this was one more than the number needed for a twothirds majority the number necessary to override a presidential veto or to propose a constitutional amendment perhaps due in part to this fact the th congress overrode the highest percentage of vetoes since andrew johnson was president of the united states even fords former reliably republican house seat was won by a democrat richard vander veen who defeated robert vanderlaan in the senate elections the democratic majority became in the seat body the economy was a great concern during the ford administration one of the first acts the new president took was to deal with the economy was to create by executive order on september the economic policy board in october in response to rising inflation ford went before the american public and asked them to whip inflation now as part of this program he urged people to wear win buttons at the time inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy more so than growing unemployment there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment to rein in inflation it was necessary to control the publics spending to try to mesh service and sacrifice win called for americans to reduce their spending and consumption on october ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of congress as a part of this speech he kicked off the win campaign over the next nine days americans mailed in win pledges in hindsight this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems the main point of that speech was to introduce to congress a oneyear fivepercent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals this plan would also take billion out of the budget bringing federal spending below billion at the time inflation was over twelve percent the federal budget ran a deficit every year ford was president despite his reservations about how the program ultimately would be funded in an era of tight public budgeting ford signed the education for all handicapped children act of which established special education throughout the united states ford expressed strong support for full educational opportunities for our handicapped children according to the official white house press release for the bill signing the economic focus began to change as the country sank into the worst recession since the great depression four decades earlier the focus of the ford administration turned to stopping the rise in unemployment which reached nine percent in may in january ford proposed a year tax reduction of billion to stimulate economic growth along with spending cuts to avoid inflation ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating a tax increase to a tax reduction in congress the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts in march congress passed and ford signed into law these income tax rebates as part of the tax reduction act of this resulted in a federal deficit of around billion for the fiscal year and billion for  when new york city faced bankruptcy in mayor abraham beame was unsuccessful in obtaining fords support for a federal bailout the incident prompted the new york daily news famous headline ford to city drop dead referring to a speech in which ford declared flatly that he would veto any bill calling for a federal bailout of new york city the following month november ford changed his stance and asked congress to approve federal loans to new york city ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic in the early s an influenza strain hn shifted from a form of flu that affected primarily pigs and crossed over to humans on february an army recruit at fort dix mysteriously died and four fellow soldiers were hospitalized health officials announced that swine flu was the cause soon after public health officials in the ford administration urged that every person in the united states be vaccinated although the vaccination program was plagued by delays and public relations problems some of the population was vaccinated by the time the program was canceled in december of the vaccine was blamed for twentyfive deaths more people died from the shots than from the swine flu ford was an outspoken supporter of the equal rights amendment issuing presidential proclamation no in  in this land of the free it is right and by nature it ought to be that all men and all women are equal before the law now therefore i gerald r ford president of the united states of america to remind all americans that it is fitting and just to ratify the equal rights amendment adopted by the congress of the united states of america in order to secure legal equality for all women and men do hereby designate and proclaim august as womens equality day as president fords position on abortion was that he supported a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the states to make the choice this had also been his position as house minority leader in response to the supreme court case of roe v wade which he opposed ford came under criticism for a minutes interview his wife betty gave in in which she stated that roe v wade was a great great decision during his later life ford would identify as prochoice ford continued the dtente policy with both the soviet union and china easing the tensions of the cold war still in place from the nixon administration was the strategic arms limitation treaty salt the thawing relationship brought about by nixons visit to china was reinforced by fords december visit to that communist country in the administration entered into the helsinki accords with the soviet union creating the framework of the helsinki watch an independent nongovernmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into human rights watch ford attended the inaugural meeting of the group of seven g industrialized nations initially the g in and secured membership for canada ford supported international solutions to issues we live in an interdependent world and therefore must work together to resolve common economic problems he said in a speech according to internal white house and commission documents posted in february by the national security archive at the george washington university the gerald ford white house significantly altered the final report of the supposedly independent rockefeller commission investigating cia domestic activities over the objections of senior commission staff the changes included removal of an entire page section on cia assassination plots and numerous edits to the report by thendeputy white house chief of staff richard cheney in the middle east and eastern mediterranean two ongoing international disputes developed into crises the cyprus dispute turned into a crisis with the turkish invasion of cyprus causing extreme strain within the north atlantic treaty organization nato alliance in midaugust the greek government withdrew greece from the nato military structure in midseptember the senate and house of representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to turkey ford concerned with both the effect of this on turkishamerican relations and the deterioration of security on natos eastern front vetoed the bill a second bill was then passed by congress which ford also vetoed although a compromise was accepted to continue aid until the end of the year as ford expected turkish relations were considerably disrupted until  in the continuing arabisraeli conflict although the initial cease fire had been implemented to end active conflict in the yom kippur war kissingers continuing shuttle diplomacy was showing little progress ford considered it stalling and wrote their israeli tactics frustrated the egyptians and made me mad as hell during kissingers shuttle to israel in early march a last minute reversal to consider further withdrawal prompted a cable from ford to prime minister yitzhak rabin which included i wish to express my profound disappointment over israels attitude in the course of the negotiations failure of the negotiation will have a far reaching impact on the region and on our relations i have given instructions for a reassessment of united states policy in the region including our relations with israel with the aim of ensuring that overall american interests are protected you will be notified of our decision on march ford informed congressional leaders of both parties of the reassessment of the administration policies in the middle east reassessment in practical terms meant canceling or suspending further aid to israel for six months between march and september the united states refused to conclude any new arms agreements with israel rabin notes it was an innocentsounding term that heralded one of the worst periods in americanisraeli relations the announced reassessments upset the american jewish community and israels wellwishers in congress on may ford experienced a real shock when seventysix us senators wrote him a letter urging him to be responsive to israels request for billion in military and economic aid ford felt truly annoyed and thought the chance for peace was jeopardized it was since the september ban on arms to turkey the second major congressional intrusion upon the presidents foreign policy prerogatives the following summer months were described by ford as an americanisraeli war of nerves or test of wills after much bargaining the sinai interim agreement sinai ii was formally signed on september and aid resumed one of fords greatest challenges was dealing with the continued vietnam war american offensive operations against north vietnam had ended with the paris peace accords signed on january the accords declared a cease fire across both north and south vietnam and required the release of american prisoners of war the agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of vietnam and like the geneva conference of called for national elections in the north and south the paris peace accords stipulated a sixtyday period for the total withdrawal of us forces the accords had been negotiated by united states national security advisor kissinger and north vietnamese politburo member l c th south vietnamese president nguyen van thieu was not involved in the final negotiations and publicly criticized the proposed agreement however antiwar pressures within the united states forced nixon and kissinger to pressure thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of american forces in multiple letters to the south vietnamese president nixon had promised that the united states would defend thieus government should the north vietnamese violate the accords in december months after ford took office north vietnamese forces invaded the province of phuoc long general trn vn tr sought to gauge any south vietnamese or american response to the invasion as well as to solve logistical issues before proceeding with the invasion as north vietnamese forces advanced ford requested congress approve a million aid package for south vietnam funds that had been promised by the nixon administration congress voted against the proposal by a wide margin senator jacob k javits offered large sums for evacuation but not one nickel for military aid president thieu resigned on april publicly blaming the lack of support from the united states for the fall of his country two days later on april ford gave a speech at tulane university in that speech he announced that the vietnam war was over as far as america is concerned the announcement was met with thunderous applause  us citizens and vietnamese and third country nationals were evacuated from the south vietnamese capital of saigon during operation frequent wind in that operation military and air america helicopters took evacuees to us navy ships offshore during an approximately hour period on april to immediately preceding the fall of saigon during the operation so many south vietnamese helicopters landed on the vessels taking the evacuees that some were pushed overboard to make room for more people other helicopters having nowhere to land were deliberately crash landed into the sea after dropping off their passengers close to the ships their pilots bailing out at the last moment to be picked up by rescue boats many of the vietnamese evacuees were allowed to enter the united states under the indochina migration and refugee assistance act the act appropriated million toward the costs of assisting the settlement of indochinese refugees in all vietnamese refugees came to the united states in thousands more escaped in the years that followed north vietnams victory over the south led to a considerable shift in the political winds in asia and ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of us influence there the administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its interests in the region on two occasions once when khmer rouge forces seized an american ship in international waters and again when american military officers were killed in the demilitarized zone dmz between north and south korea the first crisis was the mayaguez incident in may shortly after the fall of saigon and the khmer rouge conquest of cambodia cambodians seized the american merchant ship mayaguez in international waters ford dispatched marines to rescue the crew but the marines landed on the wrong island and met unexpectedly stiff resistance just as unknown to the us the mayaguez sailors were being released in the operation two military transport helicopters carrying the marines for the assault operation were shot down and us servicemen were killed and wounded while approximately khmer rouge soldiers were killed despite the american losses the operation was seen as a success in the united states and ford enjoyed an point boost in his approval ratings in the aftermath the americans killed during the operation became the last to have their names inscribed on the vietnam veterans memorial wall in washington dc some historians have argued that the ford administration felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a soviet plot but work by andrew gawthorpe published in based on an analysis of the administrations internal discussions shows that fords national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local and perhaps even accidental provocation by an immature khmer government nevertheless they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other communist countries in asia the second crisis known as the axe murder incident occurred at panmunjom a village which stands in the dmz between the two koreas at the time this was the only part of the dmz where forces from the north and the south came into contact with each other encouraged by us difficulties in vietnam north korea had been waging a campaign of diplomatic pressure and minor military harassment to try and convince the us to withdraw from south korea then in august north korean forces killed two us officers and injured south korean guards who were engaged in trimming a tree in panmunjoms joint security area the attack coincided with a meeting of the conference of nonaligned nations in colombo sri lanka at which kim jongil the son of north korean leader kim ilsung presented the incident as an example of american aggression helping secure the passage of a motion calling for a us withdrawal from the south at administration meetings kissinger voiced the concern that the north would see the us as the paper tigers of saigon if they did not respond and ford agreed with that assessment after mulling various options the ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force a large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree while at the same time the air force was deployed which included b bomber flights over panmunjom the north korean government backed down and allowed the treecutting to go ahead and later issued an unprecedented official apology east timors decolonization due to political instability in portugal saw indonesia posture to annex the new state in just hours before the indonesian invasion of east timor now timor leste on december ford and kissinger had visited indonesian president suharto in jakarta and guaranteed american compliance with the indonesian operation suharto had been a key supporter of american influence in indonesia and southeast asia and ford did not desire to place pressure on the americanindonesian relationship under ford a policy of arms sales to the suharto regime began in before the invasion roughly of the indonesian armys weapons at the time of east timors invasion were provided by the us according to george h aldrich a former state department deputy legal advisor postinvasion fords military aid averaged about million annually throughout east timors occupation and arms sales increased exponentially under president carter this policy continued until  ford faced two assassination attempts during his presidency in sacramento california on september lynette squeaky fromme a follower of charles manson pointed a colt caliber handgun at ford as fromme pulled the trigger larry buendorf a secret service agent grabbed the gun and fromme was taken into custody she was later convicted of attempted assassination of the president and was sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on august  in reaction to this attempt the secret service began keeping ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later as he left the st francis hotel in downtown san francisco sara jane moore standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street pointed her caliber revolver at him moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off just before she fired a second round retired marine oliver sipple grabbed at the gun and deflected her shot the bullet struck a wall about six inches above and to the right of fords head then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver who was slightly wounded moore was later sentenced to life in prison she was paroled on december after serving years in ford appointed john paul stevens as associate justice of the supreme court of the united states to replace retiring justice william o douglas stevens had been a judge of the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit appointed by president nixon during his tenure as house republican leader ford had led efforts to have douglas impeached after being confirmed stevens eventually disappointed some conservatives by siding with the courts liberal wing regarding the outcome of many key issues nevertheless in ford praised stevens he has served his nation well ford said of stevens with dignity intellect and without partisan political concerns ford appointed judges to the united states courts of appeals and judges to the united states district courts ford reluctantly agreed to run for office in but first he had to counter a challenge for the republican party nomination former governor of california ronald reagan and the partys conservative wing faulted ford for failing to do more in south vietnam for signing the helsinki accords and for negotiating to cede the panama canal negotiations for the canal continued under president carter who eventually signed the torrijoscarter treaties reagan launched his campaign in autumn of and won numerous primaries including north carolina texas indiana and california but failed to get a majority of delegates regan withdrew from the race at the republican convention in kansas city missouri the conservative insurgency did lead to ford dropping the more liberal vice president nelson rockefeller in favor of us senator bob dole of kansas in addition to the pardon dispute and lingering antirepublican sentiment ford had to counter a plethora of negative media imagery chevy chase often did pratfalls on saturday night live imitating ford who had been seen stumbling on two occasions during his term as chase commented he even mentioned in his own autobiography it had an effect over a period of time that affected the election to some degree fords election campaign benefitted from his being an incumbent president during several anniversary events held during the period leading up to the united states bicentennial the washington dc fireworks display on the fourth of july was presided over by the president and televised nationally on july the president and first lady served as hosts at a white house state dinner for queen elizabeth ii and prince philip of the united kingdom which was televised on the public broadcasting service network the th anniversary of the battles of lexington and concord in massachusetts gave ford the opportunity to deliver a speech to in concord acknowledging the need for a strong national defense tempered with a plea for reconciliation not recrimination and reconstruction not rancor between the united states and those who would pose threats to peace speaking in new hampshire on the previous day ford condemned the growing trend toward big government bureaucracy and argued for a return to basic american virtues democratic nominee and former georgia governor jimmy carter campaigned as an outsider and reformer gaining support from voters dismayed by the watergate scandal and nixon pardon after the democratic national convention he held a huge point lead over ford in the polls however as the campaign continued the race tightened and by election day the polls showed the race as too close to call there were three main events in the fall campaign most importantly carter repeated a promise of a blanket pardon for christian and other religious refugees and also all vietnam war draft dodgers ford had only issued a conditional amnesty in response to a question on the subject posed by a reporter during the presidential debates an act which froze fords poll numbers in ohio wisconsin hawaii and mississippi ford had needed to shift just votes in ohio plus one of the other three in order to win it was the first act signed by carter on january earlier playboy magazine had published a controversial interview with carter in the interview carter admitted to having lusted in my heart for women other than his wife which cut into his support among women and evangelical christians also on september ford performed well in what was the first televised presidential debate since polls taken after the debate showed that most viewers felt that ford was the winner carter was also hurt by fords charges that he lacked the necessary experience to be an effective national leader and that carter was vague on many issues televised presidential debates were reintroduced for the first time since the election as such ford became the first incumbent president to participate in one carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates saying they gave the viewers reason to think that jimmy carter had something to offer the turning point came in the second debate when ford blundered by stating there is no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a ford administration ford also said that he did not believe that the poles consider themselves dominated by the soviet union in an interview years later ford said he had intended to imply that the soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern europeans seeking independence however the phrasing was so awkward that questioner max frankel was visibly incredulous at the response as a result of this blunder and carters promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the vietnam era during the presidential debates fords surge stalled and carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls in the end carter won the election receiving of the popular vote and electoral votes compared with and electoral votes for ford the election was close enough that had fewer than votes shifted in ohio and wisconsin both of which neighbored his home state ford would have won the electoral vote with votes to for carter though he lost in the three months between the republican national convention and the election ford had managed to close what was once an alleged point carter lead to a point margin ford carried states versus carried by carter had ford won the election the provisions of the nd amendment would have disqualified him from running in because he had served more than two years of nixons remaining term the nixon pardon controversy eventually subsided fords successor jimmy carter opened his inaugural address by praising the outgoing president saying for myself and for our nation i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land ford remained relatively active in the years after his presidency he continued to make appearances at events of historical and ceremonial significance to the nation such as presidential inaugurals and memorial services in january he became the president of eisenhower fellowships in philadelphia then served as the chairman of its board of trustees from to later in the he reluctantly agreed to be interviewed by james m naughton a new york times journalist who was given the assignment to write the former presidents advance obituary an article that would be updated prior to its eventual publication in ford published his autobiography a time to heal harperreaders digest pages a review in foreign affairs described it as serene unruffled unpretentious like the author this is the shortest and most honest of recent presidential memoirs but there are no surprises no deep probings of motives or events no more here than meets the eye during the term of office of his successor jimmy carter ford received monthly briefs by president carters senior staff on international and domestic issues and was always invited to lunch at the white house whenever he was in washington dc their close friendship developed after carter had left office with the catalyst being their trip together to the funeral of anwar elsadat in until fords death carter and his wife rosalynn visited the fords home frequently ford and carter served as honorary cochairs of the national commission on federal election reform in and of the continuity of government commission in  like presidents carter george hw bush and clinton ford was an honorary cochair of the council for excellence in government a group dedicated to excellence in government performance which provides

foregoing numerous opportunities to serve on corporate boards to keep his options open for a rematch with carter ford attacked carters conduct of the salt ii negotiations and foreign policy in the middle east and africa many have argued that ford also wanted to exorcise his image as an accidental president and to win a term in his own right ford also believed the more conservative ronald reagan would be unable to defeat carter and would hand the incumbent a second term ford was encouraged by his former secretary of state henry kissinger as well as jim rhodes of ohio and bill clements of texas to make the race on march ford announced that he would forgo a run for the republican nomination vowing to support the eventual nominee after securing the republican nomination in ronald reagan considered his former rival ford as a potential vicepresidential running mate but negotiations between the reagan and ford camps at the republican national convention were unsuccessful ford conditioned his acceptance on reagans agreement to an unprecedented copresidency giving ford the power to control key executive branch appointments such as kissinger as secretary of state and alan greenspan as treasury secretary after rejecting these terms reagan offered the vicepresidential nomination instead to george hw bush ford did appear in a campaign commercial for the reaganbush ticket

presidential nomination of before the new hampshire primary tabloid publications printed assertions that bill clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with arkansas lounge singer gennifer flowers in response the clintons appeared together on minutes where bill clinton denied the affair but acknowledged causing pain in my marriage this joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign during it hillary clinton made culturally disparaging remarks about tammy wynettes outlook on marriage as described in her classic song stand by your mannb and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas but wanted to pursue her career insteadnb the remarks were widely criticized particularly by those who were or defended stayathome mothers and in retrospect were illconsidered by her own admission bill clinton said that in electing him the nation would get two for the price of one referring to the prominent role his wife would assume beginning with daniel wattenbergs august the american spectator article the lady macbeth of little rock hillary clintons own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives at least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and lady macbeth when bill clinton took office as president in january hillary rodham

eleanor roosevelt clinton is regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in american history some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy supporters pointed out that clintons role in policy was no different from that of other white house advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husbands presidency bill clintons campaign promise of two for the price of one led opponents to refer derisively to the clintons as copresidents or sometimes the arkansas label billary the pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send clinton into imaginary discussions with the alsopoliticallyactive eleanor rooseveltnb from the time she came to washington she also found refuge in a prayer group of the fellowship that featured many wives of conservative washington figures triggered in part by the death of her father in april she publicly sought to find a synthesis of methodist teachings liberal religious political philosophy and tikkun editor michael lerners politics of meaning to overcome what she saw as americas sleeping sickness of the soul that would lead to a willingness to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century moving into a new millennium other segments of the public focused on her appearance which had evolved over time from inattention to fashion during her days in arkansas to a popular site in the early days of the world wide web devoted to showing her many different and frequently analyzed hairstyles as first lady to an appearance on the cover of vogue magazine in  in january president clinton named first lady clinton to chair a task force on national health care reform hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for arkansas education reform unconvinced regarding the merits of the north american free trade agreement nafta she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority the recommendation of the task force became known as the clinton health care plan a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations its opponents quickly derided the plan as hillarycare and it faced opposition from even some democrats in congress some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a july bus tour to rally support for the plan clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the house or the senate although democrats controlled both chambers the proposal was abandoned in september clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors the first ladys approval ratings which had generally been in the highs percent range during her first year fell to percent in april and percent by september  republicans made the clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the midterm elections which saw a net republican gain of fiftythree seats in the house election and seven in the senate election winning control of both many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the democrats defeat especially among independent voters the white house subsequently sought to downplay hillary clintons role in shaping policy opponents of universal health care would continue to use hillarycare as a pejorative label for similar plans by others along with senators ted kennedy and orrin hatch she was a force behind the passage of the state childrens health insurance program in a federal effort that provided state support for children whose parents could not provide them with health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law she promoted nationwide immunization against childhood

childhood asthma at the national institutes of health the first lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the gulf war which became known as the gulf war syndrome enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of her husbands but when the first two bills on it came from the republicancontrolled congress lacked protections for people going off welfare she urged him to veto them which he did a third version came up during his general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas critics including her past mentor edelman urged her to get the president to veto it again but she decided to support the bill which became the welfare reform act of as the best political compromise available this caused a rift with edelman that clinton later called sad and painful together with attorney general janet reno clinton helped create the office on violence against women at the department of justice in she initiated and shepherded the adoption and safe families act which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady in she was instrumental in the passage of the foster care independence act

the plight of women she encountered but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the american press corps the trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy in a september speech before the fourth world conference on women in beijing clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the peoples republic of china itself declaring that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights delegates from over countries heard her say if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference let it be that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all in doing so she resisted both internal administration and chinese pressure to soften her remarks the speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later females around the world would recite clintons key phrases she was one of the most prominent international figures during the late s to speak out against the treatment of afghan women by the taliban she helped create vital voices an international initiative sponsored by the us to promote the participation of women in the political processes of their countries it and clintons own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the northern ireland peace process first lady clinton was a subject of several investigations by the united states office of the independent counsel committees of the us congress and the press the whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a new york times report during the presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady the clintons had lost their lates investment in the whitewater development corporation at the same time their partners in that investment jim and susan mcdougal operated madison guaranty a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of rose law firm and may have been improperly subsidizing whitewater losses madison guaranty later failed and clintons work at rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed she said she had done minimal work for the bank independent counsels robert fiske and kenneth starr subpoenaed clintons legal billing records she said she did not know where they were the records were found in the first ladys white house book room after a twoyear search and delivered to investigators in early the delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been clintons staff attributed the problem to continual changes in white house storage areas since the move from the arkansas governors mansion on january clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury after several independent counsels had investigated a final report was issued in that stated there was insufficient evidence that either clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing scrutiny of the may firings of the white house travel office employees an affair that became known as travelgate began with charges that the white house had used audited financial irregularities in the travel office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from arkansas the discovery of a twoyearold white house memo caused the investigation to focus on whether hillary clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true the final independent counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made factually false statements but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings to prosecute her following deputy white house counsel vince fosters july suicide allegations were made that hillary clinton had ordered the removal of potentially damaging files related to whitewater or other matters from fosters office on the night of his death independent counsel kenneth starr investigated this and by starr was reported to be holding the investigation open despite his staff having told him there was no case to be made when starrs successor robert ray issued his final whitewater reports in no claims were made against hillary clinton regarding this an outgrowth of the travelgate investigation was the june discovery of improper white house access to hundreds of fbi background reports on former republican white house employees an affair that some called filegate accusations were made that hillary clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the white house security office the final independent counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that hillary clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter in march newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from trading in thus leading to the cattle futures controversy allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing there was a controversy that arose in early over gifts made to the white house rather than to the clintons personally that were removed and shipped to the clintons private residence during the last year of bill clintons time in office following public pressure the couple returned worth of such gifts hillary clinton faced additional criticism for having possibly solicited personal gifts shortly before being sworn in as a senator at which time she would have been barred from accepting them in the clintons relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with white house intern monica lewinsky events surrounding the lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of bill clinton by the house of representatives and later acquittal by the senate when the allegations against her husband were first made public hillary clinton stated that they were the result of a vast rightwing conspiracy characterizing the lewinsky charges as the latest in a long organized collaborative series of charges by bill clintons political enemiesnb rather than any wrongdoing by her husband she later said that she had been misled by her husbands initial claims that no affair had taken place after the evidence of president clintons encounters with lewinsky became incontrovertible she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage the white house residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period public reaction varied some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public some sympathized with her as a victim of her husbands insensitive behavior others criticized her as being an enabler to her husbands indiscretions while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around percent the highest they had ever been in her memoir she would attribute her decision to stay married to a love that has persisted for decades and add no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way bill does even after all these years he is still the most interesting energizing and fully alive person i have ever met matters surrounding the lewinsky scandal left bill clinton with substantial legal bills in hillary clinton would state that

to ease the strain in late clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from iraq would be a mistake bushs pledge to stay until the job is done was also misguided as it gave iraqis an openended

reservists and lobbied against the closure of several military bases especially those in new york she used her position on the armed services committee to forge close relationships with a number of

revealed that the couples worth was now upwards of million and that they had earned over million since with most of it coming from bill clintons books speaking engagements and other activities throughout the first half of clinton led candidates competing for the democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election senator barack obama of illinois and former senator john edwards of north carolina were her strongest competitors the biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the iraq war which obama had opposed from the beginning clinton and obama both set records for early fundraising swapping the money lead each quarter by september polling in the first six states holding democratic contests showed that clinton was leading in all of them with the races being closest in iowa and south carolina by the following month national polls showed clinton far ahead of democratic competitors at the end of october clinton suffered a rare poor debate performance against obama edwards and her other opponents obamas message of change began to resonate with the democratic electorate better than clintons message of experience the race tightened considerably especially in the early states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina with clinton losing her lead in some polls by december in the first vote of she placed third in the january iowa democratic caucus behind obama and edwards obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days with all polls predicting a victory for him in the new hampshire primary clinton gained a surprise win there on january defeating obama narrowly it was the first time a woman had won a major american partys presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection explanations for clintons new hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically especially by women after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voters question the day before the election the nature of the contest fractured in the next few days several remarks by bill clinton and other surrogates and a remark by hillary clinton concerning martin luther king jr and lyndon b johnsonnb were perceived by many as accidentally or intentionally limiting obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the postracial significance and accomplishments of his campaign despite attempts by both hillary clinton and obama to downplay the issue democratic voting became more polarized as a result with clinton losing much of her support among african americans she lost by a twotoone margin to obama in the january south carolina primary setting up with edwards soon dropping out an intense twoperson contest for the twentytwo february super tuesday states bill clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the south carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president needs to stop the south carolina campaign had done lasting damage to clinton eroding her support among the democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of obama by ted kennedy on super tuesday clinton won the largest states such as california new york new jersey and massachusetts while obama won more states they almost evenly split the total popular vote but obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the democratic proportional allocation rules the clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by super tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort lagging in internet fundraising clinton began loaning money to her campaign there was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several toplevel personnel changes obama won the next eleven february contests across the country often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over clinton on march clinton broke the string of losses by winning in ohio among other places where her criticism of nafta a major legacy of her husbands presidency helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular throughout the campaign obama dominated caucuses for which the clinton campaign largely ignored preparation obama did well in primaries where african americans or younger collegeeducated or more affluent voters were heavily represented clinton did well in primaries where hispanics or older noncollegeeducated or workingclass white voters predominated behind in delegates clintons best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted partyappointed superdelegates clintons admission in late march that her repeated campaign statements about having been under hostile fire from snipers during a march visit to us troops at tuzla air base in bosnia and herzegovina were not true attracted considerable media attention on april she won the pennsylvania primary and kept her campaign alive on may a narrowerthanexpected win in the indiana primary coupled with a large loss in the north carolina primary ended any realistic chance she had of winning the nomination she vowed to stay on through the remaining primaries but stopped attacks against obama as one advisor stated she could accept losing she could not accept quitting she won some of the remaining contests and indeed over the last three months of the campaign won more delegates states and votes than obama but she failed to overcome obamas lead following the final primaries on june obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee in a speech before her supporters on june clinton ended her campaign and endorsed obama by campaigns end clinton had won pledged delegates to obamas at the time of the clinching clinton had superdelegates to obamas with those numbers widening to versus once obama was acknowledged the winner clinton and obama each received over million votes during the nomination processnb with both breaking the previous record clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed by a very wide margin congresswoman shirley chisholms marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman clinton gave a passionate speech supporting obama at the democratic national convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall which concluded with his victory over mccain in the general election on november clintons campaign ended up severely in debt she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the million that she lent it herself the debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of  in midnovember presidentelect obama and clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as us secretary of state in his administration she was initially quite reluctant but on november she told obama she would accept the position on december presidentelect obama formally announced that clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state clinton said she did not want to leave the senate but that the new position represented a difficult and exciting adventure as part of the nomination and in order to relieve concerns of conflict of interest bill clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the william j clinton foundation and clinton global initiative the appointment required a saxbe fix passed and signed into law in december confirmation hearings before the senate foreign relations committee began on january a week before the obama inauguration two days later the committee voted to approve

of office of secretary of state and resigned from the senate that same day she became the first former first lady to serve in the united states cabinet clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that us foreign policy would change direction we have a lot of damage to repair she advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the state department and cited the need for an increased us diplomatic presence especially in iraq where the defense department had conducted diplomatic missions clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms the quadrennial diplomacy and development review which establishes specific objectives for the state departments diplomatic missions abroad it was modeled after a similar process in the defense department that she was familiar with from her time on the senate armed services committee the first such review was issued in late and called for the us leading through civilian power as a costeffective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises it also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world a cause clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women in an internal debate regarding the war in afghanistan during clinton sided with the militarys recommendations for a maximal afghanistan surge recommending troops and no public deadline for withdrawal she prevailed over vice president joe bidens opposition but eventually supported obamas compromise plan to send an additional troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal in march clinton presented russian foreign minister sergey lavrov with a reset button symbolizing us attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president dmitry medvedev the photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into russian the policy which became known as the russian reset led to improved cooperation in several areas during medvedevs time in office but relations would worsen considerably following vladimir putins return to the position in in october on a trip to switzerland clintons intervention overcame lastminute snags and saved the signing of an historic turkisharmenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two longhostile nations in pakistan she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students talk show hosts and tribal elders in an attempt to repair the pakistani image of the usnb beginning in she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against iran in an effort to force curtailment of that countrys nuclear program this would eventually lead to the multinational joint comprehensive plan of action being agreed to in  clinton and obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president clinton formed an alliance with secretary of defense gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks obama and clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely nonideological pragmatic exercise she met with him weekly but did not have the close daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents moreover certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the white house or pentagon nevertheless the president had trust in her actions in a prepared speech in january clinton drew analogies between the iron curtain and the free and unfree internet chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as the first time a senior american official had clearly defined the internet as a key element of american foreign policy in july secretary clinton visited korea vietnam pakistan and afghanistan all the while preparing for the july wedding of daughter chelsea amid much media attention in late november clinton led the us damage control effort after wikileaks released confidential state department cables containing blunt statements and assessments by us and foreign diplomats the egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis for the administration yet clintons public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of hosni mubarak was stable to a stance that there needed to be an orderly transition to a democratic participatory government to a condemnation of violence against the protesters obama came to rely upon clintons advice organization and personal connections in the behindthescenes response to developments as arab spring protests spread throughout the region clinton was at the forefront of a us response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others as the libyan civil war took place clintons shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with ambassador to the un susan rice and national security council figure samantha power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from defense secretary gates security advisor thomas e donilon and counterterrorism advisor john brennan in gaining the backing for and arab and un approval of the military intervention in libya secretary clinton testified to congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in libya despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the war powers resolution and the state departments legal advisor argued the same when the resolutions day limit for unauthorized wars was passed a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the obama administration clinton later used us allies and what she called convening power to promote unity among the libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the gaddafi regime the aftermath of the libyan civil war saw the country becoming a failed state and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate during april internal deliberations of the presidents innermost circle of advisors over whether to order us special forces to conduct a raid into pakistan against osama bin laden clinton was among those who argued in favor saying the importance of getting bin laden outweighed the risks to the us relationship with pakistan following completion of the mission on may which resulted in bin ladens death clinton played a key role in the administrations decision not to release photographs of the dead alqaeda leader during internal discussions regarding iraq in clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to us troops there all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised usiraq status of forces agreement failed in a speech before the united nations human rights council in december clinton said that gay rights are human rights and that the us would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad the same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to obama and stage the first visit to burma by a us secretary of state since as she met with burmese leaders as well as opposition leader aung san suu kyi and sought to support the burmese democratic reforms she also said that the st century would be americas pacific century a declaration that was part of the obama administrations pivot to asia during the syrian civil war clinton and the obama administration initially sought to persuade syrian president bashar alassad to engage popular demonstrations with reform then as government violence rose in august called for him to relinquish power the administration joined a number of allied countries in delivering nonlethal assistance to rebels opposed to the assad government as well as to humanitarian groups working in syria during mid clinton formed a plan with cia director david petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of syrian rebels but the proposal was rejected by the white house who

the strategy for asserting us leadership and valuesin a world of varied threats weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entitiesby combining military hard power with diplomacy and us soft power capacities in global economics development aid technology creativity and human rights advocacy as such she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach in debates over use of military force she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration in august she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in libya and the initial us response towards the syrian civil war as examples of smart power in action clinton greatly expanded the state departments use of social media including facebook and twitter both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries visvis their governments and in the mideast turmoil clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide moreover in a formulation that became known as the hillary doctrine she viewed womens rights as critical for us security interests due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state in turn there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer as the result of her actions and visibility clinton visited countries during her tenure making her the most widely traveled secretary of statenb time magazine wrote that clintons endurance is legendary the first secretary of state to visit countries such as togo and timorleste she believed that inperson visits were more important than ever in the virtual age as early as march she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should obama be reelected in in december following that reelection obama nominated senator john kerry to be clintons successor her last day as secretary of state was february upon her departure analysts commented that clintons tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect on september the us diplomatic mission in benghazi libya was attacked resulting in the deaths of the us ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans the attack questions surrounding the security of the us consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the us on october clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events on december a panel led by thomas r pickering and michael mullen issued its report on the matter it was sharply critical of state department officials in washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment it focused its criticism on the departments bureau of diplomatic security and bureau of near eastern affairs four state department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on january regarding the benghazi attack she defended her actions in response to the incident and while still accepting formal responsibility said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security congressional republicans challenged her on several points to which she responded in particular after persistent questioning about whether the administration had issued inaccurate talking points after the attack clinton responded with the muchquoted rejoinder with all due respect the fact is we had four dead americans was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that theyd they go kill some americans what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again senator in november the house intelligence committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administrations response to the attack the house select committee on benghazi was created in may and has conducted lengthy investigations related to the attack in response to an interviewers question in september about what the republicans had accomplished in congress house majority leader kevin mccarthy credited the benghazi hearings with lowering clintons poll numbers mccarthys answer contradicted the republicans previous talking points on the investigation for example outgoing speaker of the house john boehner had consistently expressed disgust at any suggestion that the hearings were politically motivated on october clinton testified at an allday and nighttime session before the committee the hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and clinton and between the committee members themselves clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy meandering repetitive line of questioning from the committee a controversy arose in march when it was revealed by the state departments inspector general that clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a nongovernment privately maintained serverin lieu of email accounts maintained on federal government serverswhen conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state some experts officials members of congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated state department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements nearly emails contained in clintons server were retroactively marked classified by the state department though none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent were later classified as secret more than were designated top secret and the rest were later designated as confidential however the intelligence communitys inspector general wrote congress to say that some of the emails contained classified state department information when originated in a joint statement released on july the inspector general of the state department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that through their review of the emails they found information that was classified when sent remained so as of their inspection and never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system they also stated unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems mrs clinton had stated over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such after allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the socalled born classified category an fbi probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the clinton server in may the inspector general of the state department criticized her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state stating that she had not requested permission to use it and even if she had she would not have been given permission the controversy occurred against the backdrop of clintons presidential election campaign and hearings held by the house select committee on benghazi when clinton left the state department she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years she and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the bill hillary chelsea clinton foundation in there she focused on early childhood development efforts including an initiative called too small to fail and a million initiative to

the democratic nomination clinton has faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from selfprofessed democratic socialist senator bernie sanders of vermont whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in american politics has resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the us and has contrasted with clintons wall street ties in the initial contest of the primaries season clinton only very narrowly won the iowa democratic caucuses held february over an increasingly popular sanders making her the first woman to win the iowa caucuses in the first primary held in new hampshire on february she lost to sanders by a wide margin sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest the nevada caucuses on february but clinton managed a fivepercentagepoint win aided by finaldays campaigning among casino workers she followed that with a lopsided victory in the south carolina primary on february these two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her effort on the march super tuesday clinton won seven of eleven contests including a string of dominating victories across the south buoyed as in south carolina by africanamerican voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over sanders she maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season with a consistent pattern throughout being that sanders did better among younger whiter more rural and more liberal voters and in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents while clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered democrats by june she had earned enough pledged delegates and supportive superdelegates for the media to consider her the presumptive nominee the next day after winning most of the states in the final major round of primaries clinton held a victory rally in brooklyn in which she became the first woman to claim the status of presumptive nominee for a major american political party by campaigns end clinton had won

valerie sulfaros study used the american national election studies feeling thermometer polls which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure to find that such polls during clintons first lady years confirm the conventional wisdom that hillary clinton is a polarizing figure with the added insight that affect towards mrs clinton as first lady tended to be very positive or very negative

newsweek found that discussion of genders role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse newsweek editor jon meacham summed the relationship between clinton and the american public by saying that the new hampshire events brought an odd truth to light though hillary rodham clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in american politics once she became secretary of state clintons image seemed to improve dramatically among the american public and become one of a respected world figure she gained consistently high approval ratings by the highest of her career except during the lewinsky scandal and her favorableunfavorable ratings during and were the highest of any active nationally prominent american political figure a internet meme texts from hillary was based around a photograph of clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages it achieved viral popularity among younger technically adept followers of politics clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early theres a certain consistency to who i am and what i do and i think people have finally said well you know i kinda get her now she continued to do well in gallups most admired man and woman poll and in she was named the most admired woman by americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall her favorability ratings dropped however after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics again by september with her presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the state department her ratings had slumped to the some of her lowest levels ever during she acknowledged that im not a natural politician in case you havent noticed journalist indira a r lakshmanan who has covered clinton extensively both as a presidential candidate and as secretary of state believes that clintons persona is almost completely different in the two roles and that while clinton definitely has the political skills that an officeholder needs clearly however something seems to happen to clinton when the task is asking people to vote for her

browner to tokyo rose in january he became chair of the senate committee on environment and public works and continued challenging mainstream science in favor of what he called sound science in accordance with the luntz memo since when he was first elected chair of the senate committee on environment and public works inhofe has been the foremost republican promoting arguments for climate change denial in the global warming controversy he famously said in the senate that global warming is a hoax and has invited contrarians to testify in committee hearings and spread his views via the committee website run by marc morano and through his access to conservative media in inhofes the greatest hoax how the global warming conspiracy threatens your future was published by worldnetdaily books presenting his global warming conspiracy theory he said that because gods still up there the arrogance of people to think that we human beings would be able to change what he is doing in the climate is to me outrageous however he says he appreciates that this does not win arguments and he has never pointed to scriptures in a debate because i know this would discredit me his opposition to climate action is as much based on concerns about overregulation of businesses and he has shown ability to work with his senate opponents on other issues in he cosponsored legislation to protect the

senate speech inhofe chaired an environment and public works hearing with contrarian views represented by baliunas and david legates and praised their year climate study then involved in the soon and baliunas controversy as a powerful new work of science against them michael e mann defended mainstream science and specifically his work which they and the bush administration disputed in the hockey stick controversy during the hearing senator jim jeffords read out an email from hans von storch saying he had resigned as editor in chief of the journal which had published the soon and baliunas paper as the peerreview had failed to detect significant methodological flaws in the paper and the critique published by mann and colleagues was valid in a continuation of these themes inhofe had a page brochure published under the seal of the united states senate reiterating his hoax statement comparing the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to a soviet style trial and in a section headed the ipcc plays hockey he attacked what he called manns flawed limited research the brochure restated themes from inhofes senate speech and in december he distributed copies of it in milan at a meeting discussing the united nations framework convention on climate change where he met green activists with posters quoting him as saying that global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people he signed a poster for them and thanked them for quoting him correctly in an october senate speech he said global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the american people it was true when i said it before and it remains true today perhaps what has made this hoax so effective is that we hear over and over that the science is settled and there is a consensus that unless we fundamentally change our way of life by limiting greenhouse gas emissions we will cause catastrophic global warming this is simply a false statement in january inhofe told bloomberg news that global warming was the secondlargest hoax ever played on the american people after the separation of church and state and that carbon dioxide would not be restricted by the clear skies act of in

misuses the science of climate change during a heat wave in july inhofe said to the tulsa world newspaper that the environmentalist movement reminded him of the third reich the big lie as you say something over and over and over and over again and people will believe it and thats their strategy in a september senate speech inhofe argued that the threat of global warming was exaggerated by the media hollywood elites and our pop culture he said that in the s the media had switched from warning of global warming to warning of global cooling and a coming ice age then in the s had returned to warming to promote climate change fears in february he told fox news that mainstream science increasingly attributed climate change to natural causes and only those individuals on the far left such as

and environmental stewardship citing heavy costs and unproven programs in may he gave support to the idea that black carbon is a significant contributor to global warming james inhofe has been a recipient of monies from the fossil fuel industry for example exxons beneficiaries in congress include the oklahoma senator jim inhofe who called global warming a hoax and who has received since

that scientists were cooking the science on december on the cnn program the situation room inhofe said that the emails showed that the science behind climate change has been pretty well debunked the fact checking organization politifact concluded that inhofes statement was false on the same day inhofe said he would lead a threeman truth squad consisting of himself and fellow senators roger wicker and john barrasso to the united nations climate change conference in copenhagen however inhofe was unable to secure meetings with any negotiators or delegations to the conference and only met with a small group of reporters the minority group of the senate committee on environment and public works prepared a report on the cru controversy published in february which listed as key players scientists including mann and jones inhofe said it showed that the controversy was about unethical and potentially illegal behavior by some of the worlds leading climate scientists on may inhofe formally requested the inspector general of the united states department of commerce to investigate how the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa had dealt with the emails and whether the emails showed any wrongdoing it found no major issues or inappropriate actions in july inhofe stated i dont think that anyone disagrees with the fact that we actually are in a cold period that started about nine years ago now thats not me talking those are the scientists that say that the union of concerned scientists said that what inhofe stated was wrong pointing to an noaa report indicating that through july had been the hottest summer on record since inhofe added that people on the other side of this argument back in january they said inhofe it has nothing to do with todays or this month or next month were looking at a long period of time we go into twenty year periods during a house committee hearing in inhofe testified i have to admitand you know confession is good for the soul i too once thought that catastrophic global warming was caused by anthropogenic gasesbecause everyone said it was under questioning from committee member jay inslee inhofe dismissed the notion that he was less knowledgeable than climate scientists saying that hed already given five speeches on the science on january inhofe returned to chairing the senate committee on environment and public works as part of a new republican majority in the senate in response to reports by noaa and nasa that the year had been the warmest globally in the temperature record he said we had the coldest in the western hemisphere in the same time frame and attributed changes to a year cycle not human activities in a debate on the same day about a bill for the keystone xl pipeline inhofe endorsed an amendment proposed by senator sheldon whitehouse climate change is real and not a hoax which passed inhofe clarified his view that climate is changing and climate has always changed and always will there is archaeological evidence of that there is biblical evidence of that there is historical evidence of that but added that there are some people who are so arrogant to think they are so powerful they can change climate on february inhofe brought a snowball on to the senate floor and tossed it before delivering remarks in which he claimed that environmentalists keep talking about global warming even though it keeps getting cold on march inhofe introduced s the fracturing regulations are effective in state hands fresh act the bill would transfer regulatory power over hydraulic fracturing from the federal government to state governments in his announcement of the bill inhofe said that hydraulic fracturing has never contaminated ground water in oklahoma the state he

commit million annually increasing three percent yearly to account for inflation to service the bonds for the next thirty years federal monies would pay for the interest on the bonds and the state

board and led a highprofile campaign to repeal the constitutional requirement that mandated the construction of the highspeed system voters repealed the constitutional amendment many who voted believed they were supporting the train though in fact a yes vote was to approve the repeal fdot spokesperson nazih haddah commented that the rhetoric was inflammatory and misleading it was really

resulted in the court ordering the epa to specify which waterways in the us are considered protected by the clean water act flake and senator mccain sent a letter to the head of the epa citing a number of reasons why the regulation would hurt arizona one of the senators concerns was about waterways that only flow in certain parts of the year flake and mccain believe that if the epa includes those types of waterways in the new regulations the regulations would have a negative effect on arizonas agriculture industry one of the reasons the epa is using in deciding which waterways will fall under the new regulation is by concluding whether pollution in waterways will negatively affect other waters downstream flake and mccain asserted in their letter that little proof existed to back up such a conclusion but the epa responded by saying that the proposed regulation was carefully examined and was made with bipartisan input additionally flake and mccain wrote that the new changes could make it harder for arizona firefighters to fight wildfires flake advocated against the rule for two primary reasons first flake wrote that the epa proposed rule did not make a distinction between waterways that flow all year or just part of the year flake cited that percent of arizonas waterways do not flow continuously yearround and because of that the lack of distinction in the rule would affect most of arizonas waterways second flake argued that the scientific evidence used by the epa to back up the rule was anything but settled flake and mccain warned the epa administrator about their concerns earlier in the year via a letter sent on may  an editorial published by the arizona republic said that the epa rule would have the effect of requiring the cap canal to treat drinking water twice which would increase costs to arizona residents the editorial claims that the canal and all water sources that go to peoples homes already has to meet safe drinking water act regulations

soon decided to follow callaway and run for governor himself in the democratic primary he ran as a moderate alternative to both the liberal former governor ellis arnall and the conservative lester maddox in a press conference he described his ideology as conservative moderate liberal and middleoftheroad i believe i am a more complicated person than that he lost the democratic primary but drew enough votes as a thirdplace candidate to force arnall into a runoff election with maddox a chain of events then resulted in maddox the dark horse candidate being elected governornote the result was a sharp blow to carter who was left deeply in debt his attempt to rescue the race from callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist maddox which he considered an even worse outcome carter returned to his agriculture business and during the next four years carefully planned his next campaign for governor in this period was a spiritual turning point for carter he grew increasingly evangelical undertaking several religious missions in other states inspired by his sister ruth and liberal theologians such as reinhold niebuhr he declared himself born again a growing movement in s america his last child amy was born around this time the liberal former governor carl sanders was carters main opponent in the democratic primary carter ran a more modern campaign this

andrew young and visited many blackowned businesses he also praised wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in georgia he implied support or dislike of private schools depending on the

democratic party chair to fill russells unexpired term in the senate with carters reluctance to engage in backslapping and political favors the legislature found him frustrating to work with he looked

on it he implemented zerobased budgeting within state departments and added a judicial selection commission to verify the credentials of judges appointed by the governor the reorganization plan was submitted in january but had a cool reception in the legislature after two weeks of negotiations it was passed at midnight on the last day of the session ultimately he merged about state agencies into

of black state employees judges and board members he hired rita jackson samuels a black woman to advise him on potential appointments he placed portraits of martin luther king jr and two other

corps of engineers was underestimating both the projects cost and its impact on the region the veto won the attention of environmentalists nationwide when lieutenant william calley was convicted in a

public appearances he was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the democratic national convention where the liberal us senator george mcgovern was the likely presidential nominee carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative antimcgovern voters so that the convention would consider him for mcgoverns running mate on a compromise ticket he endorsed senator henry scoop jackson in part to distance himself from george wallace carter was still fairly obscure at the time and his attempt at triangulation failed the democratic ticket went to

carter as lawrence shoup noted in his book the carter presidency and beyond what carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media

severing connections to the southern baptist convention over its opposition to women as pastors what led carter to take this action was a doctrinal statement by the convention adopted in june advocating a literal interpretation of the bible this statement followed a position of the convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands carter described the reason for his decision as due to an increasing inclination on the part of southern baptist convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a southern baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them the new york times called carters action the highestprofile defection yet from the southern baptist convention in subsequent years carter has joined with other world leaders who

over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment he said that the view that women are inferior is not confined to one faith nor tragically does its influence stop at the walls of the church mosque synagogue or temple carter stated the truth is that male religious leaders have hadand still havean option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women they have for their own selfish ends overwhelmingly chosen the latter their continuing choice provides the foundation or justification for much of the pervasive persecution and abuse of women throughout the world this is in clear violation not just of the universal declaration of human rights but also the teachings of jesus christ the apostle paul moses and the prophets muhammad and founders of other great religionsall of whom have called for proper and equitable treatment of all the children of god it is time we had the courage to challenge these views in he published a call to

it saying i believe jesus would i dont have any verse in scripture i believe jesus would approve gay marriage but thats just my own personal belief i think jesus would encourage any love affair if it was honest and sincere and was not damaging to anyone else and i dont see that gay marriage damages anyone else carter ignited debate in september when he stated i think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward president barack obama is based on the fact that he is a black man that he is africanamerican obama disagreed with carters assessment on cnn obama stated are there people out there who dont like me because of race im sure there are thats not the overriding issue here in a interview with amnesty international carter criticized the use of torture at

governor ronald reagan projected an easy selfconfidence in contrast to carters serious and introspective temperament what many people believed to be carters personal attention to detail his pessimistic attitude his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people were accentuated in contrast to reagans charismatic charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates reagan used the economic problems iran hostage crisis and lack of washington cooperation to portray carter as a weak and ineffectual leader carter was the first elected president since hoover in to lose a reelection bid in the years since then his reputation has much improved carters presidential approval rating at percent just prior to the election was polled in early at percent his postpresidency activities have been favorably received carter believes that george h w bush who actively sought him out and was far more courteous and interested in his advice than reagan contributed to the rise in his reputation

regarding foreign policy during his first decade in the senate biden focused on arms control issues in response to the refusal of the us congress to ratify the salt ii treaty signed in by soviet leader leonid brezhnev and president jimmy carter biden took the initiative to meet the soviet foreign minister andrei gromyko educated him about american concerns and interests and secured several changes to address objections of the foreign relations committee when the reagan administration wanted to interpret the salt i treaty loosely in order to allow the strategic defense initiative to proceed biden argued for strict adherence to the treatys terms biden clashed again with the reagan administration in over economic sanctions against south africa he received considerable attention when he excoriated secretary of state george p shultz at a senate hearing because of the administrations support of that country which continued to practice the apartheid system biden ran for the democratic presidential nomination formally declaring his candidacy at the wilmington train station on june he was attempting to become the youngest president since john f kennedy when the campaign began biden was considered a potentially strong candidate because of his moderate image his speaking ability on the stump his appeal to baby boomers his high profile position as chair of the senate judiciary committee at the upcoming robert bork supreme court nomination hearings and his fundraising appeal he raised million in the first quarter of more than any other candidate by august bidens campaign whose messaging was confused due to staff rivalries had begun to lag behind those of michael dukakis and dick gephardt although he had still raised more funds than all candidates but dukakis and was seeing an upturn in iowa polls in september the campaign ran into trouble when he was accused of plagiarizing a speech that had been made earlier that year by neil kinnock leader of the british labour party kinnocks speech included the lines why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university then pointing to his wife in the audience why is glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick while bidens speech included the lines i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university then pointing to his wife in the audience why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because im the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that i was smarter than the rest biden had in fact cited kinnock as the source for the formulation on previous occasions but he made no reference to the original source at the august democratic debate at the iowa state fair being reported on nor in an august interview for the national education association moreover while political speeches often appropriate ideas and language from each other bidens use came under more scrutiny because he fabricated aspects of his own familys background in order to match kinnocks biden was soon found to have earlier that year lifted passages from a speech by robert f kennedy for which biden aides took the blame and a short phrase from the inaugural address of john f kennedy and in two prior years to have done the same with a passage from hubert h humphrey a few days later bidens plagiarism incident in law school came to public light video was also released showing that when earlier questioned by a new hampshire resident about his grades in law school biden had stated that he had graduated in the top half of his class that he had attended law school on a full scholarship and that he had received three degrees in college each of which was untrue or exaggerations of his actual record the kinnock and school revelations were magnified by the limited amount of other news about the nomination race at the time when most of the public were not yet paying attention to any of the campaigns biden thus fell into what the washington post writer paul taylor described as that years trend a trial by media ordeal biden lacked a strong demographic or political group of support to help him survive the crisis he withdrew from the nomination race on september saying his candidacy had been overrun by the exaggerated shadow of his past mistakes after biden withdrew from the race it was revealed that the dukakis campaign had secretly made a video highlighting the bidenkinnock comparison and distributed it to news outlets later in the delaware supreme courts board of professional responsibility cleared biden of the law school plagiarism charges regarding his standing as a lawyer saying biden had not violated any rules in february after suffering from several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain biden was taken by longdistance ambulance to walter reed army medical center and given lifesaving surgery to correct an intracranial berry aneurysm that had begun leaking the situation was serious enough that a priest had administered last rites at the hospital while recuperating he suffered a pulmonary embolism which represented a major complication another operation to repair a second aneurysm which had caused no symptoms but was also at risk from bursting was performed in may the hospitalization and recovery kept biden from his duties in the us senate for seven months biden has had no recurrences or effects from the aneurysms since then in retrospect bidens family came to believe that the early end to his presidential campaign had been a blessing in disguise for had he still been campaigning in the midst of the primaries in early he might well have not have stopped to seek medical attention and the condition might have become unsurvivable biden was a longtime member of the us senate committee on the judiciary he chaired it from until and he served as ranking minority member on it from until and again from until  while chairman biden presided over the two most contentious us supreme court confirmation hearings in history those for robert bork in and clarence thomas in in the bork hearings biden stated his opposition to bork soon after the nomination reversing an approval in an interview of a hypothetical bork nomination he had made the previous year and angering conservatives who thought he could not conduct the hearings dispassionately at the close biden won praise for conducting the proceedings fairly and with good humor and courage as his presidential campaign collapsed in the middle of the hearings rejecting some of the less intellectually honest arguments that other bork opponents were making biden framed his discussion around the belief that the us constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy that extend beyond those explicitly enumerated in the text and that borks strong originalism was ideologically incompatible with that view borks nomination was rejected in the committee by a vote and then rejected in the full senate by a margin in the thomas hearings bidens questions on constitutional issues were often long and convoluted sometimes such that thomas forgot the question being asked viewers of the highprofile hearings were often annoyed by bidens style thomas later wrote that despite earlier private assurances from the senator bidens questions had been akin to a beanball the nomination came out of the committee without a recommendation with biden opposed in part due to his own bad experiences in with his presidential campaign biden was reluctant to let personal matters enter into the hearings biden initially shared with committee but not the public anita hills sexual harassment charges on the grounds she was not yet willing to testify after she did biden did not permit other witnesses to testify further on her behalf such as angela wright who made a similar charge and experts on harassment biden said he was striving to preserve thomass right to privacy and the decency of the hearings the nomination was approved by a vote in the full senate with biden again opposed during and afterwards biden was strongly criticized by liberal legal groups and womens groups for having mishandled the hearings and having not done enough to support hill biden subsequently sought out women to serve on the judiciary committee and emphasized womens issues in the committees legislative agenda biden was involved in crafting many federal crime laws he spearheaded the violent crime control and law enforcement act of also known as the biden crime law which included the federal assault weapons ban which expired in after its tenyear sunset period and was not renewed it also included the landmark violence against women act vawa which contains a broad array of measures to combat domestic violence in the supreme court ruled in united states v morrison that the section of vawa allowing a federal civil remedy for victims of gendermotivated violence exceeded congresss authority and therefore was unconstitutional congress reauthorized vawa in and biden has said i consider the violence against women act the single most significant legislation that ive crafted during my year tenure in the senate in and biden enlisted major american technology companies in diagnosing the problems of the austin texasbased national domestic violence hotline and to donate equipment and expertise to it in a successful effort to improve its services biden was critical of the actions of independent counsel kenneth starr

the bosnian war broke out biden was among the first to call for the lift and strike policy of lifting the arms embargo training bosnian muslims and supporting them with nato air strikes and investigating war crimes both the george h w bush administration and clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy fearing balkan entanglement in april biden spent a week in the balkans and held a tense threehour meeting with serbian leader slobodan miloevi biden related that he told miloevi i think youre a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one biden wrote an amendment in to compel the bush administration to arm the bosnians but deferred in to a somewhat softer stance preferred by the clinton administration before signing on the following year to a

moment in public life that related to foreign policy in during the kosovo war biden supported the nato bombing campaign against serbia and montenegro and cosponsored with his friend john mccain the

security and that there was no option but to eliminate that threat in october biden voted in favor of the authorization for use of military force against iraq justifying the iraq war while he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a mistake he did not push to require a us withdrawal he supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized that more soldiers were needed and that the bush administration should level with the american people about the cost and length of the conflict by late bidens stance had shifted and he opposed the troop surge of saying general david petraeus was dead flat wrong in believing the surge could work biden was instead a leading advocate for dividing iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states in november biden and leslie h gelb president emeritus of the council on foreign relations released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in iraq rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing the plan called for a third way federalizing iraq and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions in september a nonbinding resolution passed the senate endorsing such a scheme however the idea was unfamiliar had no political constituency and failed to gain traction iraqs political leadership united in denouncing the

political prisoner fathi eljahmi after meeting with leader muammar gaddafi in tripoli in may biden sharply criticized president george w bush for his speech to israels knesset in which he suggested

outrageous for the president of the united states to go to a foreign country sit in the knesset and make this kind of ridiculous statement biden later apologized for using the expletive biden further

national guard base in biden broke from liberal orthodoxy when he took legislative action to limit desegregation busing in doing so he said busing was a bankrupt idea that violated the cardinal rule of common sense and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit three years later wilmingtons federally mandated crossdistrict busing plan generated much turmoil and in trying to legislate a compromise solution biden found himself alienating both black and white voters for a while beginning in biden served as an adjunct professor at the widener university school of

least wealthy members of the senate biden stated that he was listed as the second poorest member in congress a distinction that he was not proud of but attributed to being elected early in his career biden realized early in his senatorial career how vulnerable poorer public officials are to offers of financial contributions in exchange for policy support and he pushed campaign finance reform measures during his first term during his years as a senator biden amassed a reputation for loquaciousness with his questions and remarks during senate hearings being especially known for being longwinded he has been a strong speaker and debater and a frequent and effective guest on the sunday morning talk shows in public appearances he is known to deviate from prepared remarks at will according to political analyst mark halperin he has shown a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and offputting things the new york times writes that bidens weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything nor is biden known for modesty journalist james traub has written that bidens vanity and his regard for his own gifts seem considerable even by the rarefied standards

salesmen car dealers people who know how to make a sale he has that great irish gift political columnist david s broder has viewed biden as having grown since he came to washington and since his failed presidential bid he responds to real peoplethats been consistent throughout and his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better traub concludes that biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself biden ran for the democratic nomination for president in and on the national ticket as eventual nominee barack obamas runningmate biden had thought about running for president again ever since his failed bidnb  biden declared his candidacy for president on january after having discussed running for months prior and first made a formal announcement to tim russert on meet the press on january stating he would be the best biden i can be in january delaware newspaper columnist harry f themal wrote that biden occupies the sensible center of the democratic party themal concludes that this is the position biden desires and that in a campaign he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average american not just from the terrorist threat but from the lack of health assistance crime and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world during his campaign biden focused on the war in iraq and his support for the implementation of the bidengelb plan to achieve political success he touted his record in the senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy despite speculation to the contrary biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of secretary of state focusing only on the presidency at a campaign event biden said i know a lot of my opponents out there say id be a great secretary of state seriously every one of them do you watch any of the debates joes right joes right joes right other candidates comments that joe is right in the democratic debates were converted into a biden campaign theme and ad in mid biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to obamas saying of the latter i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to onthejob training biden also said that obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas biden was noted for his oneliners on the campaign trail saying of republican thenfrontrunner rudy giuliani at the debate on october in philadelphia theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and overall bidens debate performances were an effective mixture of humor and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments biden made remarks during the campaign that attracted controversy on the day of his january announcement he spoke of fellow democratic candidate and senator barack obama i mean you got the first mainstream africanamerican who is articulate and bright and clean and a nicelooking guy i mean thats a storybook mannb this comment undermined his campaign as soon as it began and significantly damaged his fundraising capabilities it later took second place on time magazines list of top campaign gaffes for biden had earlier been criticized in july for a remark he made about his support among indian americans ive had a great relationship in delaware the largest growth in population is indianamericans moving from india you cannot go to a eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking biden later said the remark was not intended to be derogatorynb  overall biden had difficulty raising funds struggled to draw people to his rallies and failed to gain traction against the highprofile candidacies of obama and senator hillary rodham clinton he never rose above single digits in the national polls of the democratic candidates in the initial contest on january biden placed fifth in the iowa caucuses garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates biden withdrew from the race that evening saying there is nothing sad about tonight i feel no regret despite the lack of success bidens stature in the political world rose as the result of his campaign in particular it changed the relationship between biden and obama although the two had served together on the senate foreign relations committee they had not been close with biden having resented obamas quick rise to political stardom and obama having viewed biden as garrulous and patronizing now having gotten to know each other during obama appreciated bidens campaigning style and appeal to working class voters and biden was convinced that obama was the real deal since shortly following bidens withdrawal from the presidential race obama had been privately telling biden that he was interested in finding an important place for him in a possible obama administration biden declined obamas first request to vet him for the vice presidential slot fearing the vice presidency would represent a loss in status and voice from his senate position but subsequently changed his mind in a june interview on nbcs meet the press biden confirmed that although he was not actively seeking a spot on the ticket he would accept the vice presidential nomination if offered in early august obama and biden met in secret to discuss a possible vicepresidential relationship and the two hit it off well personally on august barack obama announced that biden would be his running mate the new york times reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone who has foreign policy and national security experienceand not to help the ticket win a swing state or to emphasize obamas change message other observers pointed out bidens appeal to middle class and bluecollar voters as well as his willingness to aggressively challenge republican nominee john mccain in a way that obama seemed uncomfortable doing at times in accepting obamas offer biden ruled out to him the possibility of running for president again in although comments by biden in subsequent years seemed to back off that stance with biden not wanting to diminish his political power by appearing uninterested in advancement biden was officially nominated for vice president on august by voice vote at the democratic national convention in denver colorado after his selection as a vice presidential candidate biden was criticized by his own roman catholic diocese of wilmington bishop michael saltarelli over his stance on abortion which goes against the churchs prolife beliefs and teachings the diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president biden would not be allowed to speak at catholic schools biden was soon barred from receiving holy communion by the bishop of his original hometown of scranton pennsylvania because of his support for abortion rights however biden did continue to receive communion at his local delaware parish scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state catholic voters between the democratic campaign and liberal catholic groups who stressed that other social issues should be considered as much or more than abortion and many bishops and conservative catholics who maintained abortion was paramount biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others bishop saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to bidens no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena likewise none of us should accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena bidens vice presidential campaigning gained little media visibility as far greater press attention was focused on the republican running mate alaskan governor sarah palin during one week in september for instance the pew research centers project for excellence in journalism found that biden was only included in five percent of the news coverage of the race far less than for the other three candidates on the tickets biden nevertheless focused on campaigning in economically challenged areas of swing states and trying to win over bluecollar democrats especially those who had supported hillary rodham clinton biden attacked mccain heavily despite a longstanding personal friendshipnb he would say that guy i used to know hes gone it literally saddens me as the financial crisis of reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of september and the proposed bailout of united states financial system became a major factor in the campaign biden voted in favor of the billion emergency economic stabilization act of which passed the senate  on october biden participated in the campaigns one vice presidential debate with palin postdebate polls found that while palin exceeded many voters expectations biden had won the debate overall on october biden suspended campaign events for a few days after the death of his motherinlaw during the final days of the campaign biden focused on lesspopulated older less welloff areas of battleground states especially in florida ohio and pennsylvania where polling indicated he was popular and where obama had not campaigned or performed well in the democratic primaries he also campaigned in some normally republican states as well as in areas with large catholic populations under instructions from the obama campaign biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks such as one about obama being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office which had attracted negative attention privately obama was frustrated by bidens remarks saying how many times is biden gonna say something stupid obama campaign staffers referred to biden blunders as joe bombs and kept biden uninformed about strategy discussions which in turn irked biden relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month until biden apologized on a call to obama and the two built a stronger partnership publicly obama strategist david axelrod said that any unexpected comments had been outweighed by bidens high popularity ratings nationally biden had a percent favorability rating in a pew research center poll compared to palins percent on november obama was elected president and biden vice president of the united states the obamabiden ticket won electoral college votes to mccainpalins and had a percent edge in the nationwide popular vote biden had continued to run for his senate seat as well as for vice president as permitted by delaware lawnb on november biden was also reelected as senator defeating republican christine odonnell having won both races biden made a point of holding off his resignation from the senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on january he became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term and said in all my life the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of delaware as their united states senator biden cast his last senate vote on january supporting the release of the second billion for the troubled asset relief program biden resigned from the senate later that daynb in emotional farewell remarks on the senate floor where he had spent most of his adult life biden said every good thing i have seen happen here every bold step taken in the plus years i have been here came not from the application of pressure by interest groups but through the maturation of personal relationships as the presidential transition of barack obama began biden said he was in daily meetings with obama and that mccain was still his friend the us secret service codename given to biden is celtic referencing his irish roots biden chose veteran democratic lawyer and aide ron klain to be his chief of staff and time washington bureau chief jay carney to be his director of communications biden intended to eliminate some of the explicit roles assumed by the vice presidency of his predecessor dick cheney who had established himself as an autonomous power center otherwise biden said he would not model his vice presidency on any of the ones before him but instead would seek to provide advice and counsel on every critical decision obama would make biden said he had been closely involved in all the cabinet appointments that were made during the transition biden was also named to head the new white house task force on working families an initiative aimed at improving the economic well being of the middle class as his last act as chairman of the foreign relations committee biden went on a trip to iraq afghanistan and pakistan during the second week of january meeting with the leadership of those countries biden became the th vice president of the united states on january when he was inaugurated alongside president barack obama biden is the first united states vice president from delaware and the first roman catholic to attain that office supreme court justice john paul stevens administered the oath of office to biden in the early months of the obama administration biden assumed the role of an important behindthescenes counselor one role was to adjudicate disputes between obamas team of rivals the president compared bidens efforts to a basketball player who does a bunch of things that dont show up in the stat sheet biden played a key role in gaining senate support for several major pieces of obama legislation and was a main factor in convincing senator arlen specter to switch from the republican to the democratic party biden lost an internal debate to secretary of state hillary rodham clinton regarding his opposition to sending new troops to the war in afghanistan his skeptical voice was still considered valuable within the administration however and later in bidens views achieved more prominence within the white house as obama reconsidered his afghanistan strategy biden made visits to iraq about once every two months including trips to baghdad in august and september to listen to prime minister nouri almaliki and reiterate us stances on iraqs future by this time he had become the administrations point man in delivering messages to iraqi leadership about expected progress in the country more generally overseeing iraq policy became bidens responsibility when the president said in joe you do iraq biden said iraq could be one of the great achievements of this administration bidens january visit to iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming iraqi parliamentary election resulted in of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the iraqi government two days later by biden had made eight trips there but his oversight of us policy in iraq receded with the exit in of us troops biden was also in charge of the oversight role for infrastructure spending from the obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession and stressed that only worthy projects should get funding he talked with hundreds of governors mayors and other local officials in this role during this period biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred and when he completed that role in february he said that the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent it took some time for the cautious obama and the blunt rambling biden to work out ways of dealing with each other in late april bidens offmessage response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak that he would advise family members against travelling on airplanes or subways led to a swift retraction from the white house the remark revived bidens reputation for gaffes and led to a spate of latenight television jokes themed on him being a loosetalking buffoon in the face of persistently rising unemployment through july biden acknowledged that the administration had misread how bad the economy was but maintained confidence that the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up the same month secretary of state clinton quickly disavowed bidens remarks disparaging russia as a power but despite any missteps biden still retained obamas confidence and was increasingly influential within the administration on march a microphone picked up biden telling the president that his signing of the patient protection and affordable care act was a big fucking deal during live national news telecasts white house press secretary robert gibbs replied via twitter and yes mr vice president youre right senior obama advisor valerie jarrett said that bidens loose talk is part of what makes the vice president so endearing we wouldnt change him one bit former senate colleague lindsey graham said if there were no gaffes thered be no joe hes someone you cant help but like biden gained a longrunning alter ego persona the president of vice on the satirical news site the onion which parodied his job title despite their different personalities obama and biden formed a friendship partly based around obamas daughter sasha and bidens granddaughter maisy who attended sidwell friends school together bidens most important role within the administration has been to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible on june biden represented the united states at the opening ceremony of the world cup attended the england v us game which was tied and visited egypt kenya and south africa throughout joe and jill biden maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in washington often entertaining some of their grandchildren and regularly returned to their home in delaware biden campaigned heavily for democrats in the midterm elections maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of general predictions of largescale losses for the party following largescale republican gains in the elections and the departure of white house chief of staff rahm emanuel bidens past relationships with republicans in congress became more important he led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty in december bidens advocacy within the white house for a middle ground followed by his direct negotiations with senate minority leader mitch mcconnell were instrumental in producing the administrations compromise tax package that revolved around a temporary extension of the bush tax cuts biden then took the lead in trying to sell the agreement to a reluctant democratic caucus in congress which was passed as the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of  in march obama detailed biden to lead negotiations between both houses of congress and the white house in resolving federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown by may a biden panel with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the us debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan the us debt ceiling crisis developed over the next couple of months but it was again bidens relationship with mcconnell that proved to be a key factor in breaking a deadlock and finally bringing about a bipartisan deal to resolve it in the form of the budget control act of signed on august the same day that an unprecedented us default had loomed biden had spent the most time bargaining with congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration and one republican staffer said bidens the only guy with real negotiating authority and mcconnell knows that his word is good he was a key to the deal in october biden stated that obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the presidential election with obamas popularity on the decline however in late white house chief of staff william m daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research into the idea of secretary of state clinton replacing biden on the ticket the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for obama and white house officials later said that obama had never entertained the idea bidens may statement that he was absolutely comfortable with samesex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to president obamas position which had been described as evolving biden made his statement without administration consent and obama and his aides were quite irked since obama had planned to shift position several months later in the buildup to the party convention and since biden had previously counseled the president to avoid the issue lest key catholic voters be offended gay rights advocates seized upon the biden stance and within days obama announced that he too supported samesex marriage an action in part forced by bidens unexpected remarks biden apologized to obama in private for having spoken out while obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart the incident showed that biden still struggled at times with message discipline as time wrote everyone knows that bidens greatest strength is also his greatest weakness relations were also strained between the campaigns when biden appeared to use his to bolster fundraising contacts for a possible run on his own in the presidential election and the vice president ended up being excluded from obama campaign strategy meetings the obama campaign nevertheless still valued biden as a retaillevel politician who could connect with disaffected blue collar workers and rural residents and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the obama reelection campaign began in earnest in spring an august remark before a mixedrace audience that proposed republican relaxation of wall street regulations would put yall back in chains led to a similar analysis of bidens facetoface campaigning abilities versus tendency to go off track the los angeles times wrote most candidates give the same stump speech over and over putting reporters if not the audience to sleep but during any biden speech there might be a dozen moments to make press handlers cringe and prompt reporters to turn to each other with amusement and confusion time magazine wrote that biden often goes too far and that along with the familiar washington mix of neediness and overconfidence bidens brain is wired for more than the usual amount of goofiness biden was officially nominated for a second term as vice president on september by voice vote at the democratic national convention in charlotte north carolina he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone vice presidential debate on october in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administrations record and energetically attacked the republican ticket in an effort to regain campaign momentum lost by obamas unfocused debate performance against republican nominee mitt romney the week before on november the president and vice president were elected to second terms the obamabiden ticket won electoral college votes to romneyryans and had a percent edge in the nationwide popular vote in december biden was named by obama to head the gun violence task force created to address the causes of gun violence in the united states in the aftermath of the sandy hook elementary school shooting later that month during the final days before the country fell off the fiscal cliff bidens relationship with mcconnell once more proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the american taxpayer relief act of being passed at the start of it made permanent much of the bush tax cuts but raised rates on upper income levels biden was inaugurated to a second term in the early morning of january at a small ceremony in his official residence with justice sonia sotomayor presiding a public ceremony took place on january he continued to be in the forefront as in the wake of the sandy hook elementary school shooting the obama administration put forth executive orders and proposed legislation towards new gun control measures the legislation failed to pass during the discussions that led to the october passage of the continuing appropriations act which resolved the us federal government shutdown of and the us debtceiling crisis of biden played little role this was due to senate majority leader harry reid and other democratic leaders cutting the vice president out of any direct talks with congress feeling that biden had given too much away during previous negotiations bidens violence against women act was reauthorized again in the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in the first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january with biden as cochair along with jarrett as iraq fell apart during renewed attention was paid to the bidengelb iraqi federalization plan of with some observers suggesting that biden had been right all along biden himself said that the us would follow isil to the gates of hell by a series of swearingsin and other events where biden placed his hands on women and girls and talked closely to them had attracted the attention of both the press and social media in one case a senator issued a statement afterward saying about his daughter no she doesnt think the vice president is creepy on january secret service agents heard shots were fired as a vehicle drove near bidens delaware residence at pm outside the security perimeter but the vice president and his wife jill were not home a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed on february biden gave a speech at the th academy awards to do with awareness for sexual assault he also introduced lady gaga almost years after two family members died in an automobile accident biden and his family were struck by a second family tragedy on may his son beau died of brain cancer at age after battling it for several years the nature and seriousness of the illness had not been previously disclosed to the public and biden had quietly reduced his public schedule in order to spend more time with his son who at the time of his death had been widely seen as the frontrunner to be the democratic nominee for governor of delaware in the vice president issued a statement saying the entire biden family is saddened beyond words during much of his second term biden was said to be preparing for a possible bid for the democratic presidential nomination he will be on january the date on which the successful candidate will be sworn in which would have made him the oldest president on inauguration in history with his family many friends and donors encouraging him in mid to enter the race and with hillary clintons favorability ratings in decline at that time biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a draft biden pac was established as of september biden was still uncertain whether or not to run biden cited the recent death of his son being a large drain on his emotional energy and that nobody has a right to seek that office unless theyre willing to give it of who they are on october speaking from a podium in the rose garden with his wife and president obama by his side biden announced his decision not to enter the race for the democratic presidential nomination in the election in january biden affirmed not running was the right decision but he admitted to regretting not running for president every day  as of the end of january neither biden nor president barack obama had endorsed any candidate for the presidential election biden did miss his annual thanksgiving tradition of going to nantucket opting instead to travel abroad and meet with several european leaders and took time to meet with martin omalley having previously met with bernie sanders neither of these meetings were considered endorsements as biden has said that he will meet with any candidate who asks following obamas endorsement of hillary clinton on june biden also endorsed her later the same day on june biden critiqued presumptive republican nominee donald trumps proposal to temporarily ban muslims from entering the country as well as his stated intent to build a wall between the united states and mexico border furthering that trumps suggestion to either torture and or kill family members of terrorists was both damaging to american values and deeply damaging to our security biden has supported deficit spending on fiscal stimulus in the american recovery and reinvestment act of the increased infrastructure spending proposed by the obama administration mass transit including amtrak bus and subway subsidies samesex marriage and the reduced military spending proposed in the obama administrations fiscal year budget a method that political scientists use for gauging ideology is to compare the annual ratings by the americans for democratic action ada with the ratings by the american conservative union acu biden has a lifetime liberal percent score from the ada through while the acu awarded biden a lifetime conservative rating of percent through using another metric biden has a lifetime average liberal score of percent according to a national journal analysis that places him ideologically among the center of senate democrats as of the almanac of american politics rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the political spectrum in three policy areas economic social and foreign for bidens average ratings were as follows the economic rating was percent liberal and percent conservative the social rating was percent liberal and percent conservative and the foreign rating was percent liberal and

funding under kasich including both charter and district schools has ranged from a low of billion in fiscal year to billion in fiscal year which was higher than its previous peak under kasichs predecessor ted strickland as calculated by the howard fleetereducation tax policy institute kasich has proposed total school funding of billion in fiscal year and fiscal year the ohio department of educationwhich includes more spending areas than fleeters does and so reports higher numbersprojects total school funding for ohio schools to rise to slightly under billion by the end of fiscal year  analysts disagree on whether kasichs education budgets give increases beyond inflation in the state budget kasich used his lineitem veto power to cut more than million of funding from public schools according to a september story in the columbus dispatch kasich favors allowing public school districts to teach alternatives to evolutionsuch as intelligent designif local school officials want to under the philosophy of local control in november kasich urged the invasion of iraq telling a crowd of students at the ohio state university we should go to war with iraq its not likely that saddam hussein will give up his weapons if he did he would be disgraced in the arab world in an interview in august kasich said i would never have committed ourselves to iraq a kasich spokesman subsequently said that kasich was not revising history but was instead saying that the iraq war was a mistake given the facts available now kasich has said that the us shouldve left a base in iraq instead of withdrawing troops in  in kasich said that airstrikes were insufficient to combat the islamic state of iraq and the levant and he would send us ground troops to fight isil kasich opposed the landmark international nuclear agreement with iran and in september was one of fourteen republican governors who sent a letter to president obama stating that we intend to ensure that the various statelevel sanctions against iran that are now in effect remain in effect despite the agreement kasich has expressed support for the uss drone program he has said however that the program should be overseen by the department of defense and not by the cia kasich has said that he wants to lift budget sequestration for military spending and spend more if necessary in november kasich said that if elected president he would send a carrier battle group through the south china sea to send a message to china regarding their claims of sovereignty there in the us house of representatives in kasich voted for the defense of marriage act which barred federal recognition of samesex marriage during this period kasich supported a ban on samesex marriage in ohio and stated that he did not approve of the gay lifestyle as governor of ohio kasich signed an executive order banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation for state employees this was more narrow than the previous executive order signed by his predecessor because it omitted protections for gender identity during the presidential campaign kasich struck a more moderate tone compared to his republican opponents in june following the us supreme courts decision in obergefell v hodges which held that there is a fundamental right to samesex marriage under the fourteenth amendment kasich said that he was obviously disappointed and that he believes in traditional marriage but that the ruling was the law of the land and well abide by it and that it was time to move on to other issues kasich indicated that he did not support an amendment to the us constitution to overturn the decision in response to a debate question about how he would explain his position on samesex marriage to one of his daughters if she were gay kasich responded the court has ruled and i said well accept it and guess what i just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay because somebody doesnt think the way i do doesnt mean that i cant care about them or cant love them so if one of my daughters happened to be that of course i would love them and i would accept them because you know what thats what were taught when we have strong faith in september kasich commented on the highly publicized case of kim davis the rowan county kentucky clerk who refused to comply with a federal court order directing her to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples saying now i respect the fact that this lady doesnt agree but shes also a government employee shes not running a church i wouldnt force this on a church but in terms of her responsibility i think she has to comply i dont think i dont like the fact that shes sitting in a jail thats absurd as well but i think she should follow the law while in the us house of representatives kasich had a mixed record on gun policy he was one of representatives to vote for the federal assault weapons ban which became law in but voted against the brady handgun violence prevention act brady bill which established current background check laws as governor kasich shifted to more progun positions in he signed one bill permitting concealed handguns in bars and another making it easier for people with misdemeanor drug convictions to purchase guns in kasich signed a bill allowing gun owners to transport weapons with loaded magazines in their vehicles and expanding concealed carry permit reciprocity in december kasich signed legislation that reduced the numbers of hours of training required to obtain a concealed carry permit and eliminated the training requirement for permit renewals kasich opted to accept medicaidexpansion funding provided by the patient protection and affordable care act aca or obamacare in ohio this decision angered many statehouse republicans who wanted kasich to reject the expansion total spending on medicaid by the state was almost billion or percent below estimates for the fiscal year ending in june according to a report by kasichs administration the lowerthanexpected costs were attributed to expanded managed care shorter nursing home stays and increased inhome care for seniors capitated reimbursement policies increased automation to determine eligibility for the program and pay care providers and an improving economy in the state which allowed some participants to move out of the program in an october interview kasich said that repeal of the aca was not gonna happen and stated that the opposition to it was really either political or ideological i dont think that holds water against real flesh and blood and real improvements in peoples lives kasich later said that he was referring solely to the laws medicaid expansion and that my position is that we need to repeal and replace the rest of the law in kasich expressed support for many provisions of the aca ensuring coverage for people with preexisting conditions the use of insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion but opposed mandates in while running for governor kasich expressed support for amending the us constitution to abolish the fourteenth amendments guarantee of jus soli birthright citizenship for people born in the united states kasich also told the columbus dispatch at the time that one thing that i dont want to reward is illegal immigration in kasich acknowledged that his stance on immigration has evolved because maybe im a little smarter now stating i dont want to see anybody in pain so i guess when i look at this now i look at it differently than i did in when i look at a group of people who might be hiding who may be afraid who may be scared who have children i dont want to be in a position of where i make it worse for them that year kasich expressed openness to a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants saying at a republican governors association rga meeting in florida i dont like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line but we may have to do it kasich was the only governor at the rga conference to express openly a willingness to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in august while running for president kasich called for a path to legal status but not necessarily citizenship for undocumented immigrants and for a guest worker program kasich also appeared to disavow his earlier stance against birthright citizenship stating i dont think we need to go there called for completion of a fence along the usmexico border and noted that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the us as young children may obtain drivers licenses in ohio in october kasich criticized donald trumps plan to build a wall along the mexican border and remove immigrants who entered the united states illegally calling these notions just crazy in kasich defended his lieutenant governor mary taylor after taylors chief of staff and that chief of staffs administrative assistant resigned following a timesheet probe kasich said of taylors handling of the matter mary did the right thing and i support her upon taking office in kasich received criticism for appointing an initial allwhite cabinet of members responding to criticism for not appointing any black hispanic or asian cabinet members kasich said i dont look at things from the standpoint of any of these sort of metrics that people tend to focus on race or age or any of those things its not the way i look at things i want the best possible team i can get shortly afterward on february kasich made his first minority appointment to the cabinet naming michael colbert a black man to lead the ohio department of job and family services throughout his first gubernatorial campaign kasich opposed the ohio hub highspeed passenger rail project a proposed mile clevelandtocincinnati train and promised to cancel it as governorelect kasich lobbied the federal government to use million in federal dollars allocated for highspeed rail for freight rail projects instead in a november letter to kasich transportation secretary ray lahood wrote that the federal funding was specifically allocated by the economic stimulus act for highspeed rail and could not be used for other purposes in a december meeting with president barack obama kasich again unsuccessfully lobbied to use the grant money for freight rail rather than highspeed rail in december the us department of transportation announced that ohio would lose the million in grant funds allocated for highspeed passenger rail since kasich had informed them that he had no intention of ever building highspeed rail projects almost million had already been spent for preliminary engineering the million was instead diverted to other states such as california new york and florida which planned highspeed rail using the grant money for its congressionally intended purpose outgoing governor ted strickland who championed the project expressed disappointment saying that the loss of funding for the project was one of the saddest days during my four years as governor and that i cant understand the logic of giving up these vital jobcreating resources to california and florida at a time when so many ohioans need jobs kasich is an opponent of the cincinnati streetcar project in april kasich signed a twoyear transportation budget bill which allocated billion for highway construction and maintenance million to local governments for road and bridge projects and an additional million over the last budget for public transportation in february kasich signed into law a bill which cut six days from ohios early voting period including the golden week a period at the beginning of early voting when voters could both register to vote and cast an inperson absentee ballot the measures were hotly contested in the state legislature passing on a partyline vote with republicans in favor and democrats opposed this measure prompted two federal lawsuits one brought by the american civil liberties union of ohio on behalf of the naacp and league of women voters of ohio resulted in a settlement in april in which the state agreed to provide evening and sunday hours for early voting in elections in ohio through the second stillpending lawsuit was brought in may by marc elias lead campaign lawyer for hillary for america that suit alleges that the ohio measures disproportionately burden black latino and young voters in july kasich said that it was pure demagoguery for hillary clinton to say that there are republicans who are deliberately trying to keep people from voting in april kasich used his lineitem veto power to veto a provision added to a highwaybudget bill by republicans in the state legislature that would have required college students who register to vote in ohio to obtain a state drivers license and vehicle registration imposing an estimated in motor vehicle costs on outofstate college students who wanted to vote in the state the veto was celebrated by voting rights advocates ohio democrats and the cleveland plain dealer editorial board which viewed the proposal as effectively a poll tax motivated by a partisan desire to limit collegetown voting in ohio justices of the ohio supreme court are elected but the governor can fill unexpired terms in may ohio supreme court associate justice evelyn lundberg stratton announced she would retire at the end of in december kasich appointed judge judith l french to strattons unexpired term which ran from january through january  in april he had announced the formation of his new day for america group formerly a group it filed as a super pac in july between april and june the super pac raised over million from reportable contributions including contributions of or more major contributors to the pac include floyd kvamme who donated philip geier jr who donated and jim dicke chairman emeritus of crown equipment corporation who donated according to fec filings kasichs campaign had million on hand at the beginning of  in may sources close to him had said he was virtually certain to run for the republican nomination for president on july kasich announced his candidacy for the republican presidential nomination during a speech at the ohio union the student union of his alma mater the ohio state university on january the new york times endorsed kasich for the republican nomination the times editorial board strongly rebuked leading candidates donald trump and senator ted cruz and wrote that kasich though a distinct underdog is the only plausible choice for republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race on the campaign trail kasich sought to project a sunny optimistic message describing himself as the prince of light and hope this marked a change in tone for kasich who had developed a reputation as an abrasive governor viewed as a longshot contender kasich took an abovethefray approach to his rivals and ran unapologetically as a candidate with experience even as others ran as outsider contenders kasich came in second place in the new hampshire primary on february behind winner trump the cincinnati enquirer reported that this was the best possible result for kasich and lent credence to the notion that he can emerge as a republican alternative to trump and cruz ultimately however kasichs message never caught on in a campaign that exposed the anger and frustration coursing through the electorate and he found himself stuck in fourth place in a threeman race trailing senator marco rubio of florida in the delegate count although rubio had dropped out of the race in march the only state won by kasich was his home state of ohio which gave him delegates in its march winnertakeall primary but still left him with a steep delegate deficit against his rivals kasichs unsuccessful campaign strategy hinged on the possibility of a contested or brokered republican national convention in which no single candidate has enough delegates to win the nomination on the first ballot something that has not happened in either of the two major parties presidential nominating conventions since kasich suspended his campaign for the republican presidential nomination ie effectively dropped out of the race on may one day after trump won the republican primary in indiana the third remaining contender cruz quit the race shortly before kasich did leaving trump as the only candidate remaining in the republican field and hence the partys presumptive nominee following his withdrawal from the race kasich did not extend his support to trump in may and june kasich said that trump was a divisive figure rather than a unifier said that he had no plans to endorse trump in the near future and ruled out accepting as position as vicepresidential running mate under trump kasich stated that it was hard to say whether he would ever endorse trump and added i cant go for dividing name calling or somebody that doesnt really represent conservative principles kasich has been married twice his first marriage was to mary lee griffith from to and they had no children griffith has campaigned for kasich since their divorce kasich and his current wife karen waldbillig a former public relations executive were married in march and have twin daughters emma and reese john has a younger brother rick age  kasich was raised a catholic but considers denominations irrelevant and stated that theres always going to be a part of me that considers myself a catholic he drifted away from his religion as an adult but came to embrace an anglican faith after both his parents were killed in a car crash by a drunk driver on august kasich has said he doesnt find god in church but does belong to the st augustine church in westerville ohio which is part of the anglican church in north america a conservative church that broke off from the episcopal church

presidential nominee adlai stevenson let the convention select the vice presential nominee kennedy finished second in the balloting losing to senator estes kefauver of tennessee kennedy received national exposure from that episode his father thought it just as well that kennedy lost due to the potential political debility of his catholicism and the strength of the eisenhower ticket one of the matters demanding kennedys attention in the senate was president eisenhowers bill for the civil rights act of kennedy cast a procedural vote on this which was considered by some as an appeasement of southern democratic opponents of the bill kennedy did vote for title iii of the act which would have given the attorney general powers to enjoin but majority leader lyndon b johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure kennedy also voted for title iv termed the jury trial amendment many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act a final compromise bill which kennedy supported was passed in september  in kennedy was reelected to a second term in the senate defeating his republican opponent boston lawyer vincent j celeste by a wide margin it was during his reelection campaign that kennedys press secretary at this time robert e thompson put together a film entitled the us senator john f kennedy story which exhibited a day in the life of the senator and showcased his family life as well as the innerworkings of his office it was the most comprehensive film produced about kennedy up to that time while kennedys father was a strong supporter of senator joseph mccarthy mccarthy was also a friend of the kennedy family as well bobby kennedy worked for mccarthys subcommittee and mccarthy dated kennedy sister patricia in the senate voted to censure mccarthy and kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure the speech however was not delivered because of kennedys hospitalization at the time the speech had the potential of putting kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by pairing his vote against that of another senator although kennedy never indicated how he would have voted the episode damaged kennedys support among members of the liberal community including eleanor roosevelt in the and elections on january kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the democratic primary election where he faced challenges from senator hubert humphrey of minnesota and senator wayne morse of oregon kennedy defeated humphrey in wisconsin and west virginia morse in maryland and oregon as well as token opposition often writein candidates in new hampshire indiana and nebraska kennedy visited a coal mine in west virginia most miners and others in that predominantly conservative protestant state were quite wary of kennedys roman catholicism his victory in west virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal at the democratic convention he gave his wellknown new frontier speech saying for the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all wonand we stand today on the edge of a new frontier but the new frontier of which i speak is not a set of promisesit is a set of challenges it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them with humphrey and morse eliminated kennedys main opponent at the los angeles convention was senator lyndon b johnson of texas kennedy overcame this formal challenge as well as informal ones from adlai stevenson the democratic nominee in and stuart symington and several favorite sons and on july the democratic convention nominated kennedy as its candidate kennedy asked johnson to be his vice presidential candidate despite opposition from many liberal delegates and kennedys own staff including his brother bobby kennedy needed johnsons strength in the south to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedys roman catholicism cuba and whether the soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decisionmaking he famously told the greater houston ministerial association on september i am not the catholic candidate for president i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic i do not speak for my church on public matters and the church does not speak for me kennedy questioned rhetorically whether onequarter of americans were relegated to secondclass citizenship just because they were catholic and once stated that no one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific in september and october kennedy appeared with republican candidate richard nixon then vice president in the first televised us presidential debates in us history during these programs nixon with a sore injured leg and his five oclock shadow was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable while kennedy choosing to avail himself of makeup services appeared relaxed leading the huge television audience to favor kennedy as the winner radio listeners either thought nixon had won or that the debates were a draw the debates are now considered a milestone in american political historythe point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics kennedys campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls on november kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the th century in the national popular vote kennedy led nixon by just twotenths of one percent to while in the electoral college he won votes to nixons were needed to win fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma kennedy was the youngest man elected president succeeding eisenhower who was then the oldest ronald reagan surpassed eisenhower as the oldest president in  john f kennedy was sworn in as the th president at noon on january in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens famously saying ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself he added all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet but let us begin in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you the address reflected kennedys confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decisionmaking structure of formergeneral eisenhower and he wasted no time in dismantling eisenhowers methods kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet we can learn our jobs together he stated much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda the president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism and kennedy abruptly cut him off asking what do you want me to do about that today kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamaras controversial decision to award the contract for the f tfx tactical fighter experimental fighterbomber to general dynamics the choice of the civilian defense department over boeing the choice of the military at the request of senator henry jackson senator john mcclellan held days of mostly closeddoor hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from februarynovember  president kennedys foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war in kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the president started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june  on the way to the summit kennedy stopped in paris to meet charles de gaulle who advised kennedy to ignore khrushchevs abrasive style the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe nevertheless de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris on june the president met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received khrushchev for his part was impressed with the presidents intelligence but thought him weak kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin he made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war shortly after the president returned home the ussr announced its intention to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any thirdparty occupation rights in either sector of the city kennedy depressed and angry assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he personally thought had a oneinfive chance of occurring in the weeks immediately after the vienna summit more than people fled from east berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the ussr kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies in a july speech kennedy announced his decision to add billion to the defense budget along with over additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us the speech received an approval rating the following month the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east berliners into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall kennedys initial reaction was to ignore this as long as free access from west to east berlin continued this course was altered when it was learned that the west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states kennedy sent vice president johnson along with a host of military personnel in convoy through west germany including sovietarmed checkpoints to demonstrate the continued commitment of the us to west berlin kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may regarding americas conduct in the emerging cold war the address detailed how american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying that for we too founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule the prior eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow the fidel castro regime in cuba the plan led by the central intelligence agency cia with help from the us military was for an invasion of cuba by a counterrevolutionary insurgency composed of ustrained anticastro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people in hopes of removing castro from power on april kennedy ordered what became known as the bay of pigs invasion ustrained cubans called brigade landed on the island no us air support was provided allen dulles director of the cia later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground by april the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the survivors after twenty months cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for million worth of food and medicine the incident made castro wary of the us and led him to believe another invasion would occur according to biographer richard reeves kennedy primarily focused on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations when it failed he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it but maybe well learn something from it in late the white house formed the special group augmented headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others the groups objectiveto overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tacticswas never pursued on october cia u spy planes took photographs of intermediaterange ballistic missile sites being built in cuba by the soviets the photos were shown to kennedy on october a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the ussr but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from closerange nuclear weapons the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit more than a third of the members of the national security council nsc favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse there was also some reaction from the international community asked in confidence that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of us missiles that had been placed in turkey by eisenhower there could also be no assurance that the assault would be effective in concurrence with a majorityvote of the nsc kennedy decided on a naval quarantine on october he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles the president exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail united nations un secretary general u thant requested that both parties reverse their decisions and enter a coolingoff period khrushchev said yes but kennedy said no one sovietflagged ship was stopped and boarded on october khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its missiles in turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm polaris missiles this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or since in the end the humanity of the two men prevailed the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the presidents credibility kennedys approval rating increased from to immediately thereafter arguing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region he worked closely with governor of puerto rico luis muoz marn for the development of the alliance of progress and began working towards the autonomy of the commonwealth of puerto rico when the president took office the eisenhower administration through the cia had begun formulating plans for the assassination of castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic kennedy privately instructed the cia that any such planning must include plausible deniability by the us his public position was in opposition in june the dominican republics leader was assassinated in the days following the event undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation robert kennedy who saw an opportunity for the us called bowles a gutless bastard to his face as one of his first presidential acts kennedy asked congress to create the peace corps his brotherinlaw sargent shriver was the first director through this program americans volunteer to help underdeveloped nations in areas such as education farming health care and construction the organization grew to members by march and the following year since over americans have joined the peace corps serving in countries when briefing kennedy eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle in regards to the regional threat in march kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos indicating privately that vietnam and not laos should be deemed americas tripwire for communisms spread in the area in may he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnams president ngo dinh diem johnson assured diem more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem in defeat of communism in south vietnam during his administration kennedy continued policies that provided political and economic support and military advice and support to the south vietnamese government late in the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh kennedy slightly increased the number of military advisors and special forces us special forces in the area from in to by late but he was reluctant to order a fullscale deployment of troops before his assassination kennedy used almost exclusively military advisors and special forces in vietnam a year and onehalf later his successor president lyndon johnson committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated us involvement with forces reaching that year and in  in late president kennedy sent roger hilsman then director of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research to assess the situation in vietnam there hilsman met sir robert thompson head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam and the concept of the strategic hamlet program was formed it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem it was implemented in early and involved some forced relocation village internment and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents it was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government by november the program waned and officially ended in  in early kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum subversive insurgency war of liberation secretary of state dean rusk voiced strong support for us involvement operation ranch hand a largescale aerial defoliation effort began on the roadsides of south vietnamb in april kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam we dont have a prayer of staying in vietnam those people hate us they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point but i cant give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to reelect me kennedy faced a crisis in vietnam by july despite increased us support the south vietnamese military was only marginally effective against procommunist viet cong forces on august just as the new us ambassador henry cabot lodge jr arrived diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces funded and trained by the cia to quell buddhist demonstrations the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup dtat to remove diem with or perhaps by his brother nhu lodge was instructed to try to get diem and nhu to step down and leave the country diem would not listen to lodge cable deptel dated august followed declaring washington would no longer tolerate nhus actions and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu if diem refused the americans would explore alternative leadership lodge stated that the only workable option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu as originally planned at weeks end kennedy learned from lodge that the diem government might due to frances assistance to nhu be dealing secretly with the communistsand might ask the americans to leave orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables at the same time the first formal antivietnam war sentiment was expressed by us clergy from the ministers vietnam committee a white house meeting in september was indicative of the very different ongoing appraisals the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the department of defense general victor krulak and the state department joseph mendenhall krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any us influence kennedy reacted saying did you two gentlemen visit the same country the president was unaware that the two men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight in october the president appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d taylor to a vietnam mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from us representatives in vietnam in meetings with mcnamara taylor and lodge diem again refused to agree to governing measures insisted upon by the us helping to dispel mcnamaras previous optimism about diem taylor and mcnamara were also enlightened by vietnams vice president nguyen ngoc tho choice of many to succeed diem should a coup occur who in detailed terms obliterated taylors information that the military was succeeding in the countryside at kennedys insistence the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals by years end and complete withdrawal in something the nsc considered a strategic fantasy the final report declared that the military was making progress that the increasingly unpopular diemled government was not vulnerable to a coup and that an assassination of diem or nhu was a possibility in late october intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot the source vietnamese general duong van minh also known as big minh wanted to know the us position kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup excluding assassination and to ensure deniability by the us later that month as the coup became imminent kennedy ordered all cables to be routed through him a policy of control and cut out was initiated to insure presidential control of us responses while cutting him out of the paper trail on november south vietnamese generals led by big minh overthrew the diem government arresting and then killing diem and nhu kennedy was shocked by the deaths he found out afterwards that minh had asked the cia field office to secure safepassage out of the country for diem and nhu but was told that hours were needed to procure a plane minh responded that he could not hold them that long news of the coup initially led to renewed confidenceboth in america and in south vietnamthat the war might be won mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia before leaving for dallas kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year he wanted an in depth study of every possible option including how to get out of there to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top when asked what he thought the president meant forrestal said it was devils advocate stuff historians disagree on whether vietnam would have escalated had kennedy survived and been reelected in fueling the debate are statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of vietnam after the election the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw a position that johnson disagreed with kennedy had signed national security action memorandum nsam dated october which ordered the withdrawal of military personnel by the end of the year such an action would have been a policy reversal but kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at american university on june  when robert kennedy was asked in what his brother would have done if the south vietnamese had been on the brink of defeat he replied wed face that when we came to it at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam us involvement in the region escalated until lyndon johnson his successor directly deployed regular us military forces for fighting the vietnam war after kennedys assassination president johnson passed nsam on november it reversed kennedys decision to withdraw troops and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese on june kennedy delivered at the high point of his rhetorical powers the commencement address at american university in washington dc also known as strategy of peace kennedy not only outlined a plan to curb nuclear arms but also laid out a hopeful yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the us and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race the president wished to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceivedyet it is the most important topic on earth world peace i speak of peace because of the new face of warin an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn i speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational men world peace like community peace does not require that each man love his neighborit requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance our problems are manmadetherefore they can be solved by man and man can be as big as he wants the president also made two announcementsthat the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and that the us had postponed planned atmospheric tests in germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east and the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer at the same time french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a francowest german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence to kennedys eyes this francogerman cooperation seemed directed against natos influence in europe on june president kennedy gave a public speech in west berlin reiterating the american commitment to germany and criticizing communism he was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner i am a citizen of berlin a million people were on the street for the speech he remarked to ted sorensen afterwards well never have another day like this one as long as we live in kennedy stated israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope and the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom subsequently as president kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel and he is credited as the founder of the usisraeli military alliance which would be continued under subsequent presidents kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship as he described it to golda meir between the us and israel kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in and beginning in was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry the mim hawk as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies which were opposed by arab neighbours such as its water project on the jordan river as result of this newly created security alliance kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government regarding the production of nuclear materials in dimona which he believed could instigate a nuclear armsrace in the middle east after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government david bengurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna when bengurion met with kennedy in new york he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being when kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated in a may letter to bengurion that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming bengurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency iaea inspections in the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime a science attach at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited according to seymour hersh the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection hersh contends the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance and with the full acquiescence of israel marc trachtenberg argued although well aware of what the israelis were doing kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with americas nonproliferation policy the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israels nuclear weapons program rodger davies the director of the state departments office of near eastern affairs concluded in march that israel was developing nuclear weapons he reported that israels target date for achieving nuclear capability was on may undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year the state department argued that if israel wanted arms it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt into contracts for the supply of us weapons continued throughout  relations between the united states and iraq became strained following the overthrow of the iraqi monarchy on july which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by brigadier abd alkarim qasim on june qasim mobilized troops along the border between iraq and kuwait declaring the latter nation an indivisible part of iraq and causing a shortlived kuwait crisis the united kingdomwhich had just granted kuwait independence on june and whose economy was heavily dependent on kuwaiti oilresponded on july by dispatching troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion at the same time kennedy dispatched a us navy task force to bahrain and the uk at the urging of the kennedy administration brought the dispute to united nations security council where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union the situation was resolved in october when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a strong arab league force in december qasims government had passed public law which restricted the british and americanowned iraq petroleum company ipcs concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced effectively expropriating of the ipc concession us officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptiansponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state which they believed to be connected senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response qasim might grab kuwait thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production or throw himself into russian arms komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent and had the potential to get iraq back on a more neutral keel in april the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there meanwhile kennedy instructed the central intelligence agency ciaunder the direction of archie roosevelt jrto begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim the antiimperialist and anticommunist iraqi baath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february while there have been persistent rumors that the cia orchestrated the coup declassified documents and the testimony of former cia officers indicate there was no direct american involvement although the cia was actively seeking to find a suitable replacement for qasim within the iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier baathist coup plot the kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a million arms deal for iraq during his fourday visit to his ancestral home of ireland in june kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the chief herald of ireland and received honorary degrees from the national university of ireland and trinity college dublin he visited the cottage at dunganstown near new ross county wexford where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to america he also became the first foreign leader to address the houses of the oireachtas the irish parliament on december the irish department of justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit troubled by the longterm dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation kennedy and khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty originally conceived in adlai stevensons presidential campaign in their vienna summit meeting in june khrushchev and kennedy reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing but the soviet union began testing nuclear weapons that september the united states responded by conducting tests five days later shortly thereafter new us satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the ussr perceived themselves to be at parity in july kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance ultimately the united states the united kingdom and the soviet union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty which prohibited atomic testing on the ground in the atmosphere or underwater but not underground the us senate ratified this and kennedy signed it into law in october france was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses kennedy called his domestic program the new frontier it ambitiously promised federal funding for education medical care for the elderly economic aid to rural regions and government intervention to halt the recession kennedy also promised an end to racial discrimination in his state of the union address he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of to a range of he proposed a reduction in the corporate tax rates from to kennedy added that the top rate should be set at if certain deductions were not eliminated for high income earners congress did not act until after his death when the top individual rate was lowered to and the top corporate rate was set at see revenue act of  to the economic club of new york he spoke in of the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now congress passed few of kennedys major programs during his lifetime but did vote them through in under his successor johnson kennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and encourage growth of the economy he presided over the first government budget to top the billion mark in and his first budget in led to the countrys first nonwar nonrecession deficit the economy which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when kennedy took office accelerated notably during his presidency despite low inflation and interest rates gdp had grown by an average of only per annum during the eisenhower presidency scarcely more than population growth at the time and had declined by during eisenhowers last twelve months in office the economy turned around and prospered during the kennedy administration gdp expanded by an average of from early to late while inflation remained steady at around and unemployment eased industrial production rose by and motor vehicle sales rose by this rate of growth in gdp and industry continued until around and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time bobby kennedy stated were going for broke their expense accounts where theyve been and what theyve been doing the fbi is to interview them all we cant lose this robert took the position that the steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices the administrations actions influenced us steel to rescind the price increase the wall street journal wrote that the administration had acted by naked power by threats by agents of the state security police yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict us steel for collusion so quickly a new york times editorial praised kennedys actions and said that the steel industrys price increase imperils the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation nevertheless the administrations bureau of budget reported the price increase would have resulted in a net gain for gdp as well as a net budget surplus the stock market which had steadily declined since kennedys election dropped shortly after the administrations action on the steel industry as president kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to furman v georgia a case that led to a moratorium on federal executions victor feguer was sentenced to death by a federal court in iowa and was executed on march kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman jimmie henderson on february changing the penalty to life in prison on march kennedy signed into law hr pl abolishing the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder in the district of columbia the only remaining jurisdiction in the united states with such a penalty the death penalty has not been applied in the district of columbia since and has now been abolished the turbulent end of statesanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the s jim crow segregation was the established law in the deep south the supreme court of the united states had ruled in in brown v board of education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional many schools especially in southern states did not obey the supreme courts decision the court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities such as buses restaurants theaters courtrooms bathrooms and beaches but it continued nonetheless kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights during the campaign he telephoned coretta scott king wife of the reverend martin luther king jr who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter robert kennedy called georgia governor ernest vandiver and obtained kings release from prison which drew additional black support to his brothers candidacy upon taking office in kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in recognizing that conservative southern democrats controlled congressional legislation historian carl m brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in would have been futile during his first year in office kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his may appointment of civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to the federal bench  in his first state of the union address in january president kennedy said the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race at the ballot box and elsewhere disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in congress including antipoverty legislation and he distanced himself from it kennedy additionally was concerned by other issues early in his presidency such as the cold war bay of pigs fiasco and the situation in southeast asia as articulated by brother robert the administrations early priority was to keep the president out of this civil rights mess civil rights movement participants mainly those on the front line in the south viewed kennedy as lukewarm especially concerning the freedom riders who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence including law enforcement officers both federal and state kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the freedom riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative fbi agents robert kennedy speaking for the president urged the freedom riders to get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up hated memories of reconstrucion after the civil war among conservative southern whites on march kennedy signed executive order which required government contractors to take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race creed color or national origin it established the presidents committee on equal employment opportunity displeased with the pace of kennedys addressing the issue of segregation martin luther king jr and his associates produced a document in calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of abraham lincoln and use an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of second emancipation proclamation kennedy did not execute the order in september james meredith enrolled at the university of mississippi but was prevented from entering attorney general robert kennedy responded by sending federal marshals while president kennedy reluctantly sent troops after the situation on campus turned violent the ole miss riot of left two dead and dozens injured but meredith did finally enroll in his first class kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the evils of reconstruction of the s and s he had been taught or believed in were true the instigating subculture at the old miss riot and at many other racially ignited events was the ku klux klan on november kennedy signed executive order prohibiting racial discrimination in federally supported housing or related facilities in early kennedy related to martin luther king jr about the prospects for civil rights legislation if we get into a long fight over this in congress it will bottleneck everything else and we will still get no bill civil rights clashes were on the rise that year brother robert and ted sorenson pressed kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front on june president kennedy intervened when alabama governor george wallace blocked the doorway to the university of alabama to stop two african american students vivian malone and james hood from attending wallace moved aside only after being confronted by deputy attorney general nicholas katzenbach and the alabama national guard which had just been federalized by order of the president that evening kennedy gave his famous civil rights address on national television and radio launching his initiative for civil rights legislationto provide equal access to public schools and other facilities and greater protection of voting rights his proposals became part of the civil rights act of the day ended with the murder of a naacp leader medgar evers in front of his home in mississippi as the president had predicted the day after his tv speech and in reaction to it house majority leader carl albert called to advise him that his twoyear signature effort in congress to combat poverty in appalachia area redevelopment administration had been defeated primarily by the votes of southern democrats and republicans earlier kennedy had signed the executive order creating the presidential commission on the status of women on december former first lady eleanor roosevelt led the commission the commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination their final report documenting legal and cultural barriers was issued in october further on june kennedy signed the equal pay act of a federal law amending the fair labor standards act aimed at abolishing wage disparity based on sex over a hundred thousand predominantly african americans gathered in washington for the civil rights march on washington for jobs and freedom on august kennedy feared the march would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in congress and declined an invitation to speak he turned over some of the details of the governments involvement to the dept of justice which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the march including the naacp and martin luther kings southern christian leadership conference sclc to ensure a peaceful demonstration the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the march would be held on a wednesday and would be over at pm thousands of troops were placed on standby kennedy watched kings speech on tv and was very impressed the march was considered a triumph of managed protest and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred afterwards the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken kennedy felt the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill nevertheless the struggle was far from over three weeks later a bomb exploded on sunday september at the th street baptist church in birmingham by the end of the day four african american children had died in the explosion and two other children shot to death in the aftermath due to this resurgent violence the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill to the outrage of the president kennedy called the congressional leaders to the white house and by the following day the original bill without the additions had enough votes to get it out of the house committee gaining republican support senator everett dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a senate filibuster the legislation was enacted by kennedys successor president lyndon b johnson prompted by kennedys memory after his assassination in november enforcing voting rights public accommodations employment education and the administration of justice in fbi director j edgar hoover who hated civilrights leader martin luther king jr and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker presented the kennedy administration with allegations that some of kings close confidants and advisers were communists concerned that the allegations if made public would derail the administrations civil rights initiatives robert kennedy and the president both warned king to discontinue the suspect associations after the associations continued robert kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the fbi to wiretap king and other leaders of the southern christian leadership conference kings civil rights organization although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of kings phones on a trial basis for a month or so hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of kings life they deemed worthy the wiretapping continued through june and was revealed in  john f kennedy initially proposed an overhaul of american immigration policy that later was to become the immigration and nationality act of sponsored by kennedys brother senator edward kennedy it dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia the policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification kennedy wanted to dismantle the selection of immigrants based on country of origin and saw this as an extension of his civil rights policies construction of the kinzua dam flooded acres ha of seneca nation land that they had occupied under the treaty of and forced seneca to relocate to salamanca new york kennedy was asked by the american civil liberties union to intervene and halt the project but he declined citing a critical need for flood control he expressed concern about the plight of the seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land damages and assistance to help mitigate their displacement the apollo program was conceived early in during the eisenhower administration as a followup to project mercury to be used as a shuttle to an earthorbital space station flights around the moon or landing on it while nasa went ahead with planning for apollo funding for the program was far from certain given eisenhowers ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight as senator kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it in constructing his presidential administration kennedy elected to retain eisenhowers last science advisor jerome wiesner as head of the presidents science advisory committee wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration having issued a report highly critical of project mercury kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for nasa administrator before the post was accepted by james e webb an experienced washington insider who served president harry s truman as budget director and undersecretary of state webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress the president and the american people kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president both because of the knowledge of the space program johnson gained in the senate working for the creation of nasa and to help keep the politically savvy johnson occupied in kennedys january state of the union address he had suggested international cooperation in space khrushchev declined as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities early in his presidency kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to johnson who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the senate kennedys advisors speculated that a moon flight would be prohibitively expensive and he was considering plans to dismantle the apollo program due to its cost however this quickly changed on april when soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union kennedy now became eager for the us to take the lead in the space race for reasons of strategy and prestige on april he sent a memo to johnson asking him to look into the status of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up after consulting with wernher von braun johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership his memo concluded that a manned moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the united states would achieve it first kennedys advisor ted sorensen advised him to support the moon landing and on may kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled special message to the congress on urgent national needs  i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the longrange exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish full text after congress authorized the funding webb began reorganizing nasa increasing its staffing level and building two new centers a launch operations center for the large moon rocket northwest of cape canaveral air force station and a manned spacecraft center on land donated through rice university in houston texas kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at rice to promote the space effort on september in which he said no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard full text on november in a cabinet meeting with nasa administrator webb and other officials kennedy explained that the moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige and that the expense was justified johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well costs for the apollo program were expected to reach billion in a september speech before the united nations kennedy urged cooperation between the soviets and americans in space specifically recommending that apollo be switched to a joint expedition to the moon khrushchev again declined and the soviets did not commit to a manned moon mission until on july almost six years after kennedys death apollo landed the first manned spacecraft on the moon president kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas at pm central standard time on friday november while on a political trip to texas to

arrested for the murder of police officer j d tippit and was subsequently charged with the assassination of kennedy he denied shooting anyone claiming he was a patsy but was killed by jack ruby on november before he could be prosecuted ruby was then arrested and convicted for the murder of oswald ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on january while the date for his new trial was being set president johnson created the warren commissionchaired by chief justice earl warrento investigate the assassination which concluded that oswald acted alone in killing kennedy and that oswald was not part of any conspiracy the results of this investigation are disputed by many the assassination proved to be an important moment in us history because of its impact on the nation and the ensuing political repercussions a fox news poll found that of americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill president kennedy while thought there had been a coverup a gallup poll in midnovember showed believed in a conspiracy and only thought oswald did it alone in the us house select committee on assassinations concluded that it believed that kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy the committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy in historian carl m brauer concluded that the publics fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of kennedys death a mass wishto undo it a requiem mass was held for kennedy at the cathedral of st matthew the apostle on november afterwards kennedy was interred in a small plot by ft in arlington national cemetery over a period of three years an estimated million people had visited his grave on march kennedys remains

monroe sang happy birthday mr president at a large party in madison square garden celebrating kennedys upcoming fortyfifth birthday the term camelot came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the kennedy administration and the charisma of him and his family the term was first publicly used by his wife in a postassassination life magazine interview with theodore h white in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary broadway musical of the same name particularly the closing lines of the title song dont let it be forgot that once there was a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as camelot therell be great presidents again but there will never be another camelot in robert dallek wrote an extensive history of kennedys health dallek was able to consult a collection of

kennedys death it was revealed that in september while kennedy was and in his first term in congress he was diagnosed by sir daniel davis at the london clinic with addisons disease a rare endocrine disorder in dr travell revealed that kennedy also had hypothyroidism the presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type aps  kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain for which he had surgery and was written up in the american medical associations archives of surgery kennedys condition may have had diplomatic repercussions as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the vienna summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the combination included hormones animal organ cells steroids vitamins enzymes and amphetamines and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity hypertension impaired judgment nervousness and mood swings kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors one of whom max jacobson was unknown to the other two as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain there were disagreements among his doctors into late over the proper balance of medication and exercise with the president preferring the former as he was short on time and desired immediate relief during that timeframe the presidents physician george burkley did set up some gym equipment in the white house basement where kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during kennedys lifetime kennedy experienced many personal family tragedies the oldest kennedy sibling joe jr was killed in action in at age over

received reports as to kennedys indiscretions kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters according to reeves this included the logistics of kennedys liaisonswhich required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from revelations about his sex life the kennedy family originally came from dunganstown county wexford ireland in patrick kennedy left his farm and boarded a ship in new ross bound for liverpool on his way to boston kennedy departed at the height of irelands great famine it was in boston he met the woman he was to marry bridget murphy c kennedys paternal greatgrandfather came to boston and took a job as a migrant worker he died several years later from cholera they had three daughters and two sons the elder son died young from cholera he left behind a widow and four children to carry on the youngest child being joseph kennedy srs father patrick joseph p j kennedy television became the primary source by which people were kept informed of events surrounding john f kennedys assassination in fact television started to come of age before the assassination on september kennedy helped inaugurate network televisions first halfhour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with cbs evening news anchor walter cronkite newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information in this sense it was the first major tv news event of its kind the tv coverage uniting the nation interpreting what went on and creating memories of this space in time all three major us television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to allnews coverage from november through november being on the air for hours making it the longest uninterrupted news event on american tv until  kennedys state funeral procession and the murder of lee harvey oswald were all broadcast live in america and in other places around the world the state funeral was the first of three in a span of months the other two were for general douglas macarthur and president herbert clark hoover all three have two things in common the commanding general of the military district of washington during those funerals was army major general philip c wehle and the riderless horse was black jack who also served in that role during lyndon b johnsons funeral the assassination had an effect on many people not only in the us but around the world many vividly remember where they were when first learning of the news that kennedy was assassinated as with the japanese attack on pearl harbor on december before it and the september attacks after it un ambassador adlai stevenson said of the assassination all of us will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours many people have also spoken of the shocking news compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassins the possible instigators and the causes of the killing as an end to innocence and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the s especially the vietnam war the us special forces had a special bond with kennedy it was president kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the special forces and giving us back our green beret said forrest lindley a writer for the us military newspaper stars and stripes who served with special forces in vietnamc this bond was shown at kennedys funeral at the commemoration of the th anniversary of kennedys death general michael d healy the last commander of special forces in vietnam spoke at arlington cemetery later a wreath in the form of the green beret would be placed on the grave continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of special forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the us navy and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in of another special forces command the navy seals which kennedy enthusiastically supported ultimately the death of president kennedy and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the american people in the political establishmenta point made by commentators from gore vidal to arthur m schlesinger jr and implied by oliver stone in several of his films such as his landmark jfk although president kennedy opposed segregation and had shown support for the civil rights of african americans he originally believed in a more measured approach to legislation given the political realities he faced in congress especially with the southern conservatives however impelled by the civil rights demonstrations of martin luther king kennedy in proposed legislative action in a radio and tv address to the nation in june a century after president abraham lincoln had signed the emancipation proclamationkennedy became the first president to call on all americans to denounce racism as morally wrong kennedys civil rights proposals led to the civil rights act of  president lyndon b johnson kennedys successor took up the mantle and pushed the landmark civil rights act through a bitterly divided congress by invoking the slain presidents memory president johnson then signed the act into law on july this civil rights law ended what was known as the solid south and certain provisions were modeled after the civil rights act of signed into law by president ulysses s grant kennedys continuation of presidents harry s truman and dwight d eisenhowers policies of giving economic and military aid to south vietnam left the door open for president johnsons escalation of the conflict at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision had been made as to vietnam leading historians cabinet members and writers to continue to disagree on whether the vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived his agreement to the nsam action of withdrawing troops by the end of and his earlier speech at american university suggested he was ready to end the vietnam war the vietnam war contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties amid violent disappointment on the political landscape many of kennedys speeches especially his inaugural address are considered iconic and despite his relatively short term in office and lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents in the same league as abraham lincoln george washington and franklin d roosevelt some excerpts of kennedys inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at arlington he was posthumously awarded the pacem in terris award it was named after a encyclical letter by pope john xxiii that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations pacem in terris is latin for peace on earth president kennedy is the only president to have predeceased both his mother and father he is also the only president to have predeceased a grandparent his maternal grandmother mary josephine josie hannon died in august nine months after his assassination throughout the englishspeaking world the given name kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of president kennedy as well his brother robert in kennedy was presented with a grant of arms for all the descendants of patrick kennedy from the chief herald of ireland the design of the arms strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of the okennedys of ormonde and the fitzgeralds of desmond from whom the family is believed to be descended the crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches elements taken from the coat of arms of the united states of america and also symbolic of kennedy and his brothers kennedy received a signet ring engraved with his arms for his th birthday as a gift from his wife and the arms were incorporated into the seal of the uss john f kennedy following his assassination kennedy was honored by the canadian government by having a mountain mount kennedy named for him which his brother robert kennedy climbed in to plant a banner of the arms at the summit general the life article represented the first use of the term camelot in print and is attributed with having played a major role in establishing and fixing this image of the kennedy administration and period in the popular mind

belatedly repaid in in mccain was one of the five senators whom keating contacted in order to prevent the governments seizure of lincoln and mccain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the governments investigation of lincoln in mccain said the appearance of it was wrong its a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence and it was the wrong thing to do in the end mccain was cleared by the senate ethics committee of acting improperly or violating any law or senate rule but was mildly rebuked for exercising poor judgment in his reelection bid the keating five affair was not a major issue and he won handily gaining percent of the vote to defeat democratic community and

contributions from corporations labor unions other organizations and wealthy individuals and he made this his signature issue starting in he worked with democratic wisconsin senator russ feingold on campaign finance reform their mccainfeingold bill attempted to put limits on soft money the efforts of mccain and feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted by incumbents in both parties by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias despite sympathetic coverage in the media initial versions of the mccainfeingold act were filibustered and never came to a vote the term maverick republican became a label frequently applied to mccain and he has also used it himself in mccain opposed military operations in somalia another target of his was pork barrel spending by congress and he actively supported the line item veto act of which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court in  in the presidential election mccain was again on the short list of possible

unfolding presidential campaign the most successful of his writings it received positive reviews became a bestseller and was later made into a tv film the book traces mccains family background and childhood covers his time at annapolis and his service before and during the vietnam war concluding with his release from captivity in according to one reviewer it describes the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine its a fascinating history of a remarkable military family mccain announced his candidacy for president on september in nashua new hampshire saying he was staging a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve the leader for the republican nomination was texas governor george w bush who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment mccain focused on the new hampshire primary where his message appealed to independents he traveled on a campaign bus called the straight talk express he held many town hall meetings answering every question voters asked in a successful example of retail politics and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds one reporter later recounted that mccain talked all day long with reporters on his straight talk express bus he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldnt have and thats why the media loved him on february he won new hampshires primary with percent of the vote to bushs percent the bush campaign and the republican establishment feared that a mccain victory in the crucial south carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum the arizona republic would write that the mccainbush primary contest in south carolina has entered national political lore as a lowwater mark in presidential campaigns while the new york times called it a painful symbol of the brutality of american politics a variety of interest groups that mccain had challenged in the past ran negative ads bush borrowed mccains earlier language of reform and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused mccain in bushs presence of having abandoned the veterans on powmia and agent orange issues incensed mccain ran ads accusing bush of lying and comparing the governor to bill clinton which bush said was about as low a blow as you can give in a republican primary an anonymous smear campaign began against mccain delivered by push polls faxes emails flyers and audience plants the smears claimed that mccain had fathered a black child out of wedlock the mccains darkskinned daughter was adopted from bangladesh that his wife cindy was a drug addict that he was a homosexual and that he was a manchurian candidate who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his north vietnam pow days the bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks mccain lost south carolina on february with percent of the vote to bushs percent in part because bush mobilized the states evangelical voters and outspent mccain the win allowed bush to regain lost momentum mccain would say of the rumor spreaders i believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those according to one report the south carolina experience left mccain in a very dark place mccains campaign never completely recovered from his south carolina defeat although he did rebound partially by winning in arizona and michigan a few days later he made a speech in virginia beach that criticized christian leaders including pat robertson and jerry falwell as divisive conservatives declaring we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community but that does not mean that we will pander to their selfappointed leaders mccain lost the virginia primary on february and on march lost nine of the thirteen primaries on super tuesday to bush with little hope of overcoming bushs delegate lead mccain withdrew from the race on march he endorsed bush two months later and made occasional appearances with the texas governor during the general election campaign mccain began by breaking with the new george w bush administration on a number of matters including hmo reform climate change and gun legislation mccainfeingold was opposed by bush as well in may mccain was one of only two senate republicans to vote against the bush tax cuts besides the differences with bush on ideological grounds there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous years campaign later when a republican senator jim jeffords became an independent thereby throwing control of the senate to the democrats mccain defended jeffords against selfappointed enforcers of party loyalty indeed there was speculation at the time and in years since about mccain himself leaving the republican party but mccain has always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so beginning in mccain used political capital gained from his presidential run as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members to become one of the senates most influential members after the september attacks mccain supported bush and the usled war in afghanistan he and democratic senator joe lieberman wrote the legislation that created the commission while he and democratic senator fritz hollings cosponsored the aviation and transportation security act that federalized airport security in march mccainfeingold passed in both houses of congress and was signed into law by president bush seven years in the making it was mccains greatest legislative achievement meanwhile in discussions over proposed us action against iraq mccain was a strong supporter of the bush administrations position he stated that iraq was a clear and present danger to the united states of america and voted accordingly for the iraq war resolution in october he predicted that us forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the iraqi people in may mccain voted against the second round of bush tax cuts saying it was unwise at a time of war by november after a trip to iraq he was publicly questioning

mentioned for the vicepresidential slot only this time as part of the democratic ticket under nominee john kerry mccain said that kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had at the republican national convention mccain supported bush for reelection praising bushs management of the war on terror since the september attacks at the same time he defended kerrys vietnam war record by august mccain had the best favorabletounfavorable rating percent to percent of any national politician he campaigned for bush much more than he had four years previously though the two remained situational allies rather than friends mccain was also up for reelection as senator in he defeated littleknown democratic schoolteacher stuart starky with his biggest margin of victory garnering percent of the vote in may mccain led the socalled gang of in the senate which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees but only in extraordinary circumstances the compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement but some republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances mccain subsequently cast supreme court confirmation votes in favor of john roberts and samuel alito calling them two of the finest justices ever appointed to the united states supreme court breaking from his and votes mccain supported the bush tax cut extension in may saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase working with democratic senator ted kennedy mccain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform which would involve legalization guest worker programs and border enforcement components the secure america and orderly immigration act was never voted on in while the comprehensive immigration reform act of passed the senate in may but failed in the house in june president bush mccain and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill the comprehensive immigration reform act of but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an amnesty program and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the senate by the middle of the s decade the increased indian gaming that mccain had helped bring about was a billion industry he was twice chairman of the senate indian affairs committee in and and his committee helped expose the jack abramoff indian lobbying scandal by and mccain was pushing for amendments to the indian gaming regulatory act that would limit creation of offreservation casinos as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos owing to his time as a pow mccain has been recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the war on terror in october mccain introduced the mccain detainee amendment to the defense appropriations bill for and the senate voted to support the amendment it prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners including prisoners at guantanamo bay by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the us army field manual on interrogation although bush had threatened to veto the bill if mccains amendment was included the president announced in december that he accepted mccains terms and would make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad this stance among others led to mccain being named by time magazine in as one of americas best senators mccain voted in february against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by bush however the bill in question contained other provisions to which mccain objected and his spokesman stated this wasnt a vote on waterboarding this was a vote on applying the standards of the army field manual to cia personnel meanwhile mccain continued questioning the progress of the war in iraq in september he remarked upon chairman of the joint chiefs of staff richard myers optimistic outlook on the wars progress things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected nor as we were told by you general myers in august he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency we have not told the american people how tough and difficult this could be from the beginning mccain strongly supported the iraq troop surge of the strategys opponents labeled it mccains plan and university of virginia political science professor larry sabato said mccain owns iraq just as much as bush does now the surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year even within the republican party as mccains presidential campaign was underway faced with the consequences mccain frequently responded i would much rather lose a campaign than a war in march mccain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in iraq as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began mccain formally announced his intention to run for president of the united states on april in portsmouth new hampshire he stated that im not running for president to be somebody but to do something to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things mccains oftcited strengths as a presidential candidate for included national name recognition sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives his ability to reach across the aisle his wellknown military service and experience as a pow his experience from the presidential campaign and an expectation that he would capture bushs top fundraisers during the election cycle mccain had attended events and helped raise more than million on behalf of republican candidates mccain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make despite being considered the frontrunner for the nomination by pundits as began mccain was in second place behind former mayor of new york city rudy giuliani in national republican polls as the year progressed mccain had fundraising problems in the first half of due in part to his support for the comprehensive immigration reform act of which was unpopular among the republican base electorate largescale campaign staff downsizing took place in early july but mccain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race later that month the candidates campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed mccain slumped badly in national polls often running third or fourth with percent or less support the arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog riding the straight talk express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events by december the republican race was unsettled with none of the toptier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the republican base electorate mccain was showing a resurgence in particular with renewed strength in new hampshire the scene of his triumph and was bolstered further by the endorsements of the boston globe the new hampshire union leader and almost two dozen other state newspapers as well as from senator lieberman now an independent democrat mccain decided not to campaign significantly in the january iowa caucuses which saw a win by former governor of arkansas mike huckabee mccains comeback plan paid off when he won the new hampshire primary on january defeating former governor of massachusetts mitt romney in a close contest to once again become one of the frontrunners in the race in midjanuary mccain placed first in the south carolina primary narrowly defeating mike huckabee pundits credited the thirdplace finisher tennessees former us senator fred thompson with drawing votes from huckabee in south carolina thereby giving a narrow win to mccain a week later mccain won the florida primary beating romney again in a close contest giuliani then dropped out and endorsed mccain on february mccain won both the majority of states and delegates in the super tuesday republican primaries giving him a commanding lead toward the republican nomination romney departed from the race on february mccains wins in the march primaries clinched a majority of the delegates and he became the presumptive republican nominee mccain having been born in the panama canal zone if elected would have become the first president who was born outside the current states this raised a potential legal issue since the united states constitution requires the president to be a naturalborn citizen of the united states a bipartisan legal review and a unanimous but nonbinding senate resolution both concluded that he is a naturalborn citizen also if inaugurated in at age years and days he would have been the oldest us president upon ascension to the presidency and the secondoldest president to be inaugurated mccain addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns stating in that his health was excellent he had been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma and an operation in for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face mccains prognosis appeared favorable according to independent experts especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years in may mccains campaign briefly let the press review his medical records and he was described as appearing cancerfree having a strong heart and in general being in good health upon clinching enough delegates for the nomination mccains focus shifted toward the general election while barack obama and hillary rodham clinton fought a prolonged battle for the democratic nomination mccain introduced various policy proposals and sought to improve his fundraising cindy mccain who accounts for most of the couples wealth with an estimated net worth of million made part of her tax returns public in may after facing criticism about lobbyists on staff the mccain campaign issued new rules in may to avoid conflicts of interest causing five top aides to leave when obama became the democrats presumptive nominee in early june mccain proposed joint town hall meetings but obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall in july a staff shakeup put steve schmidt in full operational control of the mccain campaign throughout these summer months obama typically led mccain in national polls by singledigit margins and also led in several key swing states mccain reprised his familiar underdog role which was due at least in part to the overall challenges republicans faced in the election year mccain accepted public financing for the general election campaign and the restrictions that go with it while criticizing his democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in the republicans broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead compared to obamas alaska governor sarah palin was revealed as mccains surprise choice for running mate on august mccain was only the second us majorparty presidential nominee to select a woman for running mate and the first republican to do so palin would have become the first female vice president of the united states if she had been elected on september mccain and palin became the republican partys presidential and vice presidential nominees respectively at the republican national convention in saint paul minnesota mccain surged ahead of obama in national polls following the convention as the palin pick energized core republican voters who had previously been wary of him however by the campaigns own later admission the rollout of palin to the national media went poorly and voter reactions to palin grew increasingly negative especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications on september mccain said he was suspending his campaign called on obama to join him and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with obama in order to work on the proposed us financial system bailout before congress which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and liquidity crisis mccains intervention helped to give dissatisfied house republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement after obama declined mccains suspension suggestion mccain went ahead with the debate on september on october mccain voted in favor of a revised billion rescue plan another debate was held on october like the first one polls afterward suggested that obama had won it a final presidential debate occurred on october  during and after the final debate mccain compared obamas proposed policies to socialism and often invoked joe the plumber as a symbol of american small business dreams that would be thwarted by an obama presidency mccain barred using the jeremiah wright controversy in ads against obama but the campaign did frequently criticize obama regarding his purported relationship with bill ayers mccains rallies became increasingly vitriolic with attendees denigrating obama and displaying a growing antimuslim and antiafricanamerican sentiment after one female mccain supporter said she did not trust obama because hes an arab mccain pointedly replied to the woman no maam hes a decent family man citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues mccains response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in american politics down the stretch mccain was outspent by obama by a fourtoone margin the election took place on november and barack obama was projected the winner at about pm eastern standard time mccain delivered his concession speech in phoenix arizona about twenty minutes later in it he noted the historic and special significance of obama becoming the nations first african american president in the end mccain won electoral college votes to obamas mccain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally republican ones mccain gained percent of the nationwide popular vote compared to obamas percent following his defeat mccain returned to the senate amid varying views about what role he might play there in midnovember he met with presidentelect obama and the two discussed issues they had commonality on around the same time mccain indicated that he intended to run for reelection to his senate seat in as the inauguration neared obama consulted with mccain on a variety of matters to an extent rarely seen between a presidentelect and his defeated rival and president obamas inauguration speech contained an allusion to mccains theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself nevertheless mccain emerged as a leader of the republican opposition to the obama economic stimulus package of saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect mccain also voted against obamas supreme court nomination of sonia sotomayor saying that while undeniably qualified i do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint and by august was siding more often with his republican party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career mccain reasserted that the afghanistan war was winnable and criticized obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional us troops there mccain also harshly criticized obama for scrapping construction of the us missile defense complex in poland declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past and strongly opposed the obama health care plan mccain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the militarys dont ask dont tell policy towards gays factors involved in mccains new direction included senate staffers leaving a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government a possible republican primary challenge from conservatives in and mccains campaign edge being slow to wear off as one longtime mccain advisor said a lot of people including me thought he might be the republican building bridges to the obama administration but hes been more like the guy blowing up the bridges in early a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former us congressman j d hayworth materialized in the us senate election in arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the tea party movement with hayworth using the campaign slogan the consistent conservative mccain said despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions i never considered myself a maverick i consider myself a person who serves the people of arizona to the best of his abilities the primary challenge coincided with mccain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts closing of the guantnamo bay detention facility campaign finance restrictions and gays in the military when the health care plan now called the patient protection and affordable care act passed congress and became law in march mccain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in congress as a consequence he warned that congressional republicans would not be working with democrats on anything else there will be no cooperation for the rest of the year they have poisoned the well in what theyve done and how theyve done it mccain became a vocal defender of arizona sb the april tough antiillegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal governments inability to control the border in the august primary mccain beat hayworth by a to percent margin mccain proceeded to easily defeat democratic city councilman rodney glassman in the general election in the lame duck session of the th congress mccain voted for the compromise tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of but against the dream act which he had once sponsored and the new start treaty most prominently he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against dont ask dont tell repeal in his opposition he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the senate floor and called its passage a very sad day that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military while control of the house of representatives went over to the republicans in the th congress the senate stayed democratic and mccain continued to be the ranking member of the senate armed services committee as the arab spring took center stage mccain urged that the embattled egyptian president hosni mubarak step down and thought the us should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power mccain was an especially vocal supporter of the military intervention in libya in april of that year he visited the antigaddafi forces and national transitional council in benghazi the highestranking american to do so and said that the rebel forces were my heroes in june he joined with senator kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention and said the administrations disregard for the elected representatives of the american people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive in august mccain voted for the budget control act of that resolved the us debt ceiling crisis in november mccain and senator carl levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the national defense authorization act for fiscal year that terrorism suspects no matter where captured could be detained by the us military and its tribunal system following objections by civil libertarians some democrats and the white house mccain and levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to us citizens in the republican party presidential primaries mccain endorsed former rival mitt romney and campaigned for him but compared the contest to a greek tragedy due to its drawnout nature with massive super pacfunded attack ads damaging all the contenders he labelled the supreme courts citizens united v federal election commission decision as uninformed arrogant nave and decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring said it would become considered the courts worst decision in the st century mccain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the budget control act of and gained attention for defending state department aide huma abedin against charges brought by a few house republicans that she had ties to the muslim brotherhood mccain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the sunday morning news talk shows he became one of the most vocal critics of the obama administrations handling of the september attack on the us diplomatic mission in benghazi saying it was a debacle that featured either a massive coverup or incompetence that is not acceptable and that it was worse than the watergate scandal as part of this he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of ambassador to the un susan rice to succeed hillary rodham clinton as us secretary of state mccains friend and colleague john kerry was nominated instead regarding the syrian civil war that had begun in mccain repeatedly argued for the us intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the antigovernment forces he staged a visit to rebel forces inside syria in may the first senator to do so and called for arming the free syrian army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a nofly zone over the country following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven lebanese shiite pilgrims the year before mccain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other following the ghouta chemical weapons attack mccain argued again for strong american military action against the government of the syrian president bashar alassad and in september cast a foreign relations committee vote in favor of obamas request to congress that it authorize a military response mccain took the lead in

during mccain was a member of a bipartisan group of senators the gang of eight which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform the resulting border security economic opportunity and immigration modernization act of passed the senate by a margin but faced an uncertain future in the house in july mccain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against obama administration executive nominees without democrats resorting to the nuclear option that would disallow such filibusters altogether however the option would be imposed later in the year anyway much to the senators displeasure these developments and some other negotiations showed that mccain now had improved relations with the obama administration including the president himself as well as with democratic senate majority leader harry reid and that he had become the leader of a power center in the senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment they also led some observers to conclude that the maverick mccain had returned mccain was publicly skeptical about the republican strategy that precipitated the us federal government shutdown of and us debtceiling crisis of in order to defund or delay the affordable care act in october he voted in favor of the continuing appropriations act which resolved them and said republicans have to understand we have lost this battle as i predicted weeks ago that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable similarly he was one of nine republican senators who voted for the bipartisan budget act of at the end of the year by early mccains apostasies were enough that the arizona republican party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been disastrous and harmful mccain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of obamas foreign policy however and in june following major gains by the islamic state in iraq and the levant in the northern iraq offensive decried what he saw as a us failure to protect its past gains in iraq and called on the presidents entire national security team to resign mccain said could all this have been avoided the answer is absolutely yes if i sound angry its because i am angry mccain was a supporter of the euromaidan protests against ukraine leader viktor yanukovych and his government and appeared in independence square in kiev in december following the russian military intervention in ukraine mccain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to ukrainian military forces

and norway respectively arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising unlike many republicans mccain supported the release and contents of the senate intelligence committee report on cia torture in december saying the truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow it sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad it is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us but the american people are entitled to it nonetheless he added that the cias practices following the september attacks had stained our national honor while doing much harm and little practical good and that our enemies act without conscience we must not he opposed the obama administrations december decision to normalize relations with cuba as the th united states congress assembled in january with republicans in control of the senate mccain became chair of the armed services committee a longtime goal of his in this position he led the writing of proposed senate

the sentiments expressed in that speech saying he had serious concerns about trumps uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues relations between the two had been fraught

captured following trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on may mccain said that republican voters had spoken and he would support trump mccain was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from democratic congresswoman ann kirkpatrick in the general election and privately expressed worry over the effect that trumps unpopularity among hispanic voters might have on his own

and percent liberal columnists such as robert robb and matthew continetti have used a formulation devised by william f buckley jr to describe mccain as conservative but not a conservative meaning that while mccain usually tends towards conservative positions he is not anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern american conservatism following his presidential election loss mccain began adopting more orthodox conservative views the magazine national journal rated mccain along with seven of his colleagues as the most conservative senators for and he achieved his first percent rating from the american conservative union for that year from the late s until mccain was a board member of project vote smart which was set up by richard kimball his senate opponent the project provides nonpartisan information about the political positions of mccain and other candidates for political office additionally mccain uses his senate website to describe his political positions mccains personal character has been a dominant feature of his public image this image includes the military service of both himself and his family the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second his maverick political persona his temper his admitted problem of occasional illconsidered remarks and his close ties to his children from both his marriages mccains political appeal has been more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians his stature and reputation stem partly from his service in the vietnam war he also carries physical vestiges of his war wounds as well as his melanoma surgery when campaigning he quips i am older than dirt and have more scars than frankenstein writers often extolled mccain for his courage not just in war but in politics and wrote sympathetically about him mccains shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the presidential campaign including his selfrepudiation of the maverick label left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the mccain they thought they had known by some aspects of the older mccain had returned and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies including as one writer listed the maverick the former maverick the curmudgeon the bridge builder the war hero bent on transcending the call of selfinterest to serve a cause greater than himself the sore loser old bull last lion loose cannon happy warrior elder statesman lion in winter in his own estimation the arizona senator is straightforward and direct but impatient other traits include a penchant for lucky charms a fondness for hiking and a sense of humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly as when he made a joke in about the clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers do you know why chelsea clinton is so ugly because janet reno is her father mccain subsequently apologized profusely and the clinton white house accepted his apology mccain has not shied away from addressing his shortcomings and apologizing for them he is known for sometimes being prickly and hottempered with senate colleagues but his relations with his own senate staff have been more cordial and have inspired loyalty towards him he formed a strong bond with two senators joe lieberman and lindsey graham over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel and they became dubbed the three amigos mccain acknowledges having said intemperate things in years past though he also says that many stories have been exaggerated one psychoanalytic comparison suggests that mccain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper and cultural critic julia keller argues that voters want leaders who are passionate engaged fiery and feisty mccain has employed both profanity and shouting on occasion although such incidents have become less frequent over the years senator lieberman has made this observation it is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control he is a very controlled person senator thad cochran who has known mccain for decades and has battled him over earmarks expressed concern about a mccain presidency he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me ultimately cochran decided to support mccain for president after it was clear he would win the nomination all of mccains family members are on good terms with him and he has defended them against some of the negative consequences of his highprofile political lifestyle his familys military tradition extends to the latest generation son john sidney iv jack graduated from the us naval academy in becoming the fourth generation john s mccain to do so and is a helicopter pilot son james served two tours with the marines in the iraq war and son doug flew jets in the navy his daughter meghan became a blogging and twittering presence in the debate about the future of the republican party following the elections and showed

him to congressman richard m kleberg who made johnson his legislative secretary johnson was elected speaker of the little congress a group of congressional aides where he cultivated congressmen

duty three days after the japanese attack on pearl harbor in december his orders were to report to the office of the chief of naval operations in washington dc for instruction and training following his training he asked undersecretary of the navy james forrestal for a combat assignment he was sent instead to inspect the shipyard facilities in texas and on the west coast in the spring of president roosevelt needed his own reports on what conditions were like in the southwest pacific roosevelt felt that information which flowed up the military chain of command needed to get delivered by a highly trusted political aide from a suggestion by forrestal president roosevelt assigned johnson to a threeman survey team of the southwest pacific johnson reported to general douglas macarthur in australia johnson and two us army officers went to the nd bomb group base which was assigned the high risk mission of bombing the japanese airbase at lae in new guinea johnsons roommate was an army second lieutenant who was a b bomber pilot on june johnson volunteered as an observer for an air strike mission on new guinea by eleven b bombers that included his roommate in another plane while on the mission his roommate and his crews b bomber was shot down with none of the eight men surviving the crash into the water reports vary on what happened to the b bomber carrying johnson during that mission johnsons biographer robert caro accepts johnsons account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned the aircraft was attacked disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective though remaining under heavy fire others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire this is said to be supported by official flight records other airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target at about the same time that johnsons plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase macarthur recommended johnson for the silver star for gallantry in action after it was approved by the army he personally presented the medal to johnson johnson who had used a camera as an observer reported to roosevelt to the navy leaders and to congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable he argued that the south west pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies the warplanes sent there for example were far inferior to japanese planes and morale was bad he told forrestal that the pacific fleet had a critical need for additional experienced men johnson prepared a twelvepoint program to upgrade the effort in the region stressing greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters congress responded by making johnson chairman of a highpowered subcommittee of the naval affairs committee with a mission similar to that of the truman committee in the senate he probed the peacetime business as usual inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him johnsons biographer robert dallek concludes the mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy johnsons personal and political wishes but it also represented a genuine effort on his part however misplaced to improve the lot of americas fighting men he was released from active duty on july he was promoted to commander on october effective june he resigned from the navy reserve effective january  johnson received the silver star american campaign medal asiaticpacific campaign medal and the world war ii victory medal silver star citation for gallantry in action in the vicinity of port moresby and salamaula new guinea on june while on a mission of obtaining information in the southwest pacific area lieutenant commander johnson in order to obtain personal knowledge of combat conditions volunteered as an observer on a hazardous aerial combat mission over hostile positions in new guinea as our planes neared the target area they were intercepted by eight hostile fighters when at this time the plane in which lieutenant commander johnson was an observer developed mechanical trouble and was forced to turn back alone presenting a favorable target to the enemy fighters he evidenced marked coolness in spite of the hazards involved his gallant actions enabled him to obtain and return with valuable information in the elections johnson again ran for the senate and won in a highly controversial result in a threeway democratic party primary johnson faced a wellknown former governor coke stevenson and a third candidate johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter dubbed the johnson city windmill he raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by voting for the tafthartley act curbing union power as well as by criticizing unions stevenson came in first but lacked a majority so a runoff was held johnson campaigned even harder while stevensons efforts slumped the runoff count took a week handled by the democratic state central committee because this was a party primary johnson was finally announced the winner by votes out of cast the committee voted to certify johnsons nomination by a majority of one with the last vote cast on johnsons behalf by temple texas publisher frank w mayborn there were many allegations of voter fraud one writer alleges that johnsons campaign manager future texas governor john b connally was connected with ballots in precinct in jim wells county where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting just at the close of polling some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day robert caro argued in his book that johnson had thus stolen the election in jim wells county and that ballots were also rigged in bexar county alone election judge luis salas said in that he had certified fraudulent ballots for johnson the state democratic convention upheld johnson stevenson went to court but johnson prevailedwith timely help from his friend abe fortas he soundly defeated republican jack porter in the general election in november and went to washington permanently dubbed landslide lyndon johnson dismissive of his critics happily adopted the nickname once in the senate johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful courtships of older senators especially senator richard russell democrat from georgia the leader of the conservative coalition and arguably the most powerful man in the senate johnson proceeded to gain russells favor in the same way that he had courted speaker sam rayburn and gained his crucial support in the house johnson was appointed to the senate armed services committee and later in he helped create the preparedness investigating subcommittee johnson became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency these investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the truman administration although it can be said that the committees investigations reinforced the need for changes johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee johnson used his political influence in the senate to receive broadcast licenses from the federal communications commission in his wifes name after the general elections johnson was chosen as senate majority whip in under the new majority leader ernest mcfarland of arizona and served from to  in the general election republicans won a majority in both the house and senate among defeated democrats that year was mcfarland who lost to upstart barry goldwater in january johnson was chosen by his fellow democrats to be the minority leader he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position one of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees while retaining it for chairmanships in the election johnson was reelected to the senate and since the democrats won the majority in the senate johnson then became majority leader former majority leader william knowland became minority leader johnsons duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the democrats johnson rayburn and president dwight d eisenhower worked well together in passing eisenhowers domestic and foreign agendacitation needed during the suez crisis johnson tried to prevent the us government from criticizing the israeli invasion of the sinai peninsula along with the rest of the nation johnson was appalled by the threat of possible soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial earth satellite sputnik and used his influence to ensure passage of the national aeronautics and space act which established the civilian space agency nasa historians caro and dallek consider lyndon johnson the most effective senate majority leader in history he was unusually proficient at gathering information one biographer suggests he was the greatest intelligence gatherer washington has ever known discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues his philosophy and prejudices his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote robert baker claimed that johnson would occasionally send senators on nato trips in order to avoid their dissenting votes central to johnsons control was the treatment described by two journalists the treatment could last ten minutes or four hours it came enveloping its target at the johnson ranch swimming pool in one of johnsons offices in the senate cloakroom on the floor of the senate itselfwherever johnson might find a fellow senator within his reach its tone could be supplication accusation cajolery exuberance scorn tears complaint and the hint of threat it was all of these together it ran the gamut of human emotions its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction interjections from the target were rare johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken he moved in close his face a scant millimeter from his target his eyes widening and narrowing his eyebrows rising and falling from his pockets poured clippings memos statistics mimicry humor and the genius of analogy made the treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless a cigaretteperday smoker johnson suffered a nearfatal heart attack on july he abruptly gave up smoking as a result with only a couple of exceptions and did not resume the habit until he left the white house on january  johnsons success in the senate rendered him a potential democratic presidential candidate he had been the favorite son candidate of the texas delegation at the partys national convention in and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the nomination jim rowe repeatedly urged johnson to launch a campaign in early but johnson thought it better to wait thinking that john kennedys efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited rowe finally joined the humphrey campaign in frustration another move which johnson thought played into his own strategy johnsons late entry into the campaign in july coupled with a reluctance to leave washington allowed the rival kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among democratic state party officials johnson underestimated kennedys endearing qualities of charm and intelligence as compared to his own reputation as the more crude and wheelingdealing landslide lyndon caro suggests that johnsons hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on kennedys youth poor health and failure to take a position regarding joseph mccarthy he had formed a stop kennedy coalition with adlai stevenson stuart symington and hubert humphrey but it proved a failure johnson received votes on the only ballot at the democratic convention which nominated john f kennedy tip oneill was a representative from kennedys home state of massachusetts at that time and he recalled that johnson approached him at the convention and said tip i know you have to support kennedy at the start but id like to have you with me on the second ballot oneill replied senator theres not going to be any second ballot according to kennedys special counsel myer feldman and to kennedy himself it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which johnsons vicepresidential nomination ultimately took place kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without support of traditional southern democrats most of whom had backed johnson nevertheless labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to johnson after much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter kennedy did offer johnson the vicepresidential nomination at the los angeles biltmore hotel at am on july the morning after he was nominated and johnson accepted from that point to the actual nomination that evening the facts are in dispute in many respects convention chairman leroy collins declaration of a twothirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed seymour hersh stated that robert f kennedy known as bobby hated johnson for his attacks on the kennedy family and later maintained that his brother offered the position to johnson merely as a courtesy expecting him to decline arthur m schlesinger jr concurred with robert kennedys version of events and put forth that john kennedy would have preferred stuart symington as his runningmate alleging that johnson teamed with house speaker sam rayburn and pressured kennedy to favor johnson biographer robert caro offered a different perspective he wrote that the kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close election against richard nixon and henry cabot lodge jr johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry texas and the southern states caros research showed that on july john kennedy started the process while johnson was still asleep at am john kennedy asked robert kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes including texas robert called pierre salinger and kenneth odonnell to assist him salinger realized the ramifications of counting texas votes as their own and asked him whether he was considering a kennedyjohnson ticket and robert replied yes caro contends that it was then that john kennedy called johnson to arrange a meeting he also called pennsylvania governor david l lawrence a johnson backer to request that he nominate johnson for vice president if johnson were to accept the role according to caro kennedy and johnson met and johnson said that kennedy would have trouble with kennedy supporters who were antijohnson kennedy returned to his suite to announce the kennedyjohnson ticket to his closest supporters including northern political bosses odonnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by kennedy who had previously cast johnson as antilabor and antiliberal afterward robert kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to johnson robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and johnsonapparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without john kennedys authorization caro continues in his analysis that robert kennedy tried to get johnson to agree to be the democratic party chairman rather than vice president johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from john kennedy despite his brothers interference john kennedy was firm that johnson was who he wanted as running mate he met with staffers such as larry obrien his national campaign manager to say that johnson was to be vice president obrien recalled later that john kennedys words were wholly unexpected but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation he thought it was a stroke of genius when john and robert kennedy next saw their father joe kennedy he told them that signing johnson as running mate was the smartest thing that they had ever done at the same time as his vice presidential run johnson also sought a third term in the us senate according to robert caro on november lyndon johnson won election for both the vice presidency of the united states on the kennedyjohnson ticket and for a third term as senator he had texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices when he won the vice presidency he made arrangements to resign from the senate as he was required to do under federal law as soon as it convened on january in lloyd bentsen the vice presidential running mate of democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and also a senator from texas took advantage of lyndons law and was able to retain his seat in the senate despite dukakis loss to george h w bush johnson was reelected senator with votes percent to republican john towers percent fellow democrat william a blakley was appointed to replace johnson as senator but blakley lost a special election in may to tower after the election johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position he initially sought a transfer of the authority of senate majority leader to the vice presidency since that office made him president of the senate but faced vehement opposition from the democratic caucus including members whom he had counted as his supporters johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch he drafted an executive order for kennedys signature granting johnson general supervision over matters of national security and requiring all government agencies to cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments kennedys response was to sign a nonbinding letter requesting johnson to review national security policies instead kennedy similarly turned down early requests from johnson to be given an office adjacent to the oval office and to employ a fulltime vice presidential staff within the white house his lack of influence was thrown into relief later in when kennedy appointed johnsons friend sarah t hughes to a federal judgeship whereas johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency house speaker sam rayburn wrangled the appointment from kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill moreover many members of the kennedy white house were contemptuous of johnson including the presidents brother attorney general robert f kennedy and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque crude manner congressman tip oneill recalled that the kennedy men had a disdain for johnson that they didnt even try to hidethey actually took pride in snubbing him kennedy however made efforts to keep johnson busy informed and at the white house often telling aides i cant afford to have my vice president who knows every reporter in washington going around saying were all screwed up so were going to keep him happy kennedy appointed him to jobs such as head of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities through which he worked with african americans and other minorities kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position but taylor branch in pillar of fire contends that johnson pushed the kennedy administrations actions further and faster for civil rights than kennedy originally intended to go branch notes the irony of johnson being the advocate for civil rights when the kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters in particular he notes johnsons memorial day speech at gettysburg pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions which gave him limited insights into global issues as well as opportunities at selfpromotion in the name of showing the countrys flag he attended cabinet and national security council meetings kennedy gave johnson control over all presidential appointments involving texas and appointed him chairman of the presidents ad hoc committee for science kennedy also appointed johnson chairman of the national aeronautics space council the soviets beat the us with the first manned spaceflight in april and kennedy gave johnson the task of evaluating the state of the us space program and recommending a project that would allow the us to catch up or beat the soviets johnson responded with a recommendation that the us gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an american on the moon in the s kennedy assigned priority to the space program but johnsons appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure johnson was touched by a senate scandal in august when bobby baker the secretary to the majority leader of the senate and a protg of johnsons came under investigation by the senate rules committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance one witness alleged that baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the vice president baker resigned in october and the investigation did not expand to johnson the negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in washington circles that kennedy was planning on dropping johnson from the democratic ticket in the upcoming presidential election however on october a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have johnson on the ticket the following year kennedy replied yes to both those questions there is little doubt that robert kennedy and johnson hated each other yet john and robert kennedy agreed that dropping johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the south in the election and they agreed that johnson would stay on the ticket johnsons presidency took place during a healthy economy with steady growth and low unemployment regarding the rest of the world there were no serious controversies with major countries attention therefore focused on domestic policy and after on the vietnam war johnson was quickly sworn in as president on the air force one plane in dallas on november just hours and minutes after john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas amid suspicions of a conspiracy against the government he was sworn in by us district judge sarah t hughes a family friend in the rush a bible was not at hand so johnson took the oath of office using a roman catholic missal from president kennedys desk cecil stoughtons iconic photograph of johnson taking the presidential oath of office as mrs kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft he was convinced of the need to make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock he and the secret service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from dallas and return him to washington this was greeted by some with assertions that johnson was in too much haste to assume power in the days following the assassination lyndon b johnson made an address to congress saying that no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long the wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to johnsons promise to carry out kennedys plans and his policy of seizing kennedys legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda on november just one week after kennedys assassination johnson issued an executive order to rename nasas apollo launch operations center and the nasaair force cape canaveral launch facilities as the john f kennedy space center cape canaveral was officially known as cape kennedy from  johnson was alert to the public demand for answers to head off snowballing speculation about such conspiracies he immediately created a panel headed by chief justice earl warren known as the warren commission to investigate kennedys assassination the commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the assassination conspiracy theorists were not satisfied and they kept active for decades johnson retained senior kennedy appointees some for the full term of his presidency he even retained robert kennedy as attorney general with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship robert kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in to run for the senate although johnson had no official chief of staff walter jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the white house george reedy who was johnsons secondlongestserving aide assumed the post of press secretary when john f kennedys own pierre salinger left that post in march horace busby was another triplethreat man as johnson referred to his aides he served primarily as a speech writer and political analyst bill moyers was the youngest member of johnsons staff he handled scheduling and speechwriting parttime the new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of kennedys primary legislative goalsa tax cut johnson worked closely with harry f byrd of virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below billion in exchange for what became overwhelming senate approval of the revenue act of congressional approval followed at the end of february and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights in late johnson also launched the initial offensive of his war on poverty recruiting kennedy relative sargent shriver then head of the peace corps to spearhead the effort in march lbj sent to congress the economic opportunity act which created the job corps and the community action program designed to attack poverty locally the act also created vista volunteers in service to america a domestic counterpart to the peace corps president kennedy had submitted a civilrights bill to congress in june which was met with strong opposition johnson renewed the effort and asked bobby kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on capitol hill this provided adequate political cover for johnson should the effort fail but if it were successful johnson would receive ample credit historian robert caro notes that the bill kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote in particular they held up all of the major bills kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent especially the tax reform bill in order to force the bills supporters to pull it johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic as he played a role in a similar tactic against the civil rights bill that harry truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier in that fight a rentcontrol renewal bill was held up until the civilrights bill was withdrawn believing that the current course meant that the civil rights act would suffer the same fate he adopted a different strategy from that of kennedy who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process by tackling the tax cut first the previous tactic was eliminated passing the civil rights bill in the house required getting it through the rules committee which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed the house rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full house which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of in the senate since the tax bill had passed three days earlier the anticivilrights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty republicans who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill according to caro it was ultimately johnsons ability to convince republican leader everett dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary republican votes to overcome the filibuster in march after hours of debate the bill passed the senate by a vote of johnson signed the fortified civil rights act of into law on july legend has it that as he put down his pen johnson told an aide we have lost the south for a generation anticipating a coming backlash from southern whites against johnsons democratic party biographer randall b woods has argued that johnson effectively used appeals to judeochristian ethics to garner support for the civil rights law woods writes that johnson undermined the southern filibuster against the bill lbj wrapped white america in a moral straight jacket how could individuals who fervently continuously and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just god continue to condone racial discrimination police brutality and segregation where in the judeochristian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in alabama denying an equal education to black children barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families was jim crow to be americas response to godless communism  woods states that johnsons religiosity ran deep at he joined the disciples of christ or christian church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor the strong to assist the weak and the educated to speak for the inarticulate johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor fdr in that he paired liberal values to religious values believing that freedom and social justice served both god and man johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for eric goldman who joined the white house in december of that year thought johnsons domestic program was best captured in the title of walter lippmans book the good society richard goodwin tweaked itto the great society and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for johnson in may at the university of michigan it encompassed movements of urban renewal modern transportation clean environment antipoverty healthcare reform crime control and educational reform in august allegations arose from the military that two us destroyers had been attacked by some north vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters miles km from the vietnamese coast in the gulf of tonkin naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory although johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about vietnam out of the election campaign he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the vietnamese so he sought and obtained from the congress the gulf of tonkin resolution on august johnson determined to embolden his image on foreign policy also wanted to prevent criticism such as truman had received in korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action a response to the purported attack as well blunted presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish goldwater camp the resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commanderinchief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of seato requesting assistance johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary us goal remained the preservation of south vietnamese independence through material and advice as opposed to any us offensive posture the publics reaction to the resolution at the time was positive percent favored stronger measures in vietnam and only percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave in spring johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right a pivotal change took place in april when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike after considerable horse trading especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances by the irs johnson got an agreement this substantially boosted his selfconfidence as well as his image that same year robert f kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as johnsons vice presidential running mate but johnson and kennedy however had never liked one another and johnson afraid that kennedy would be credited with his election as president abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn kennedy was himself undecided about the position and knowing that the prospect rankled johnson was content in refusing to eliminate himself from consideration ultimately goldwaters poor polling numbers degraded any dependence johnson might have had on kennedy as his running mate hubert humphreys selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen johnson in the midwest and industrial northeast johnson knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president put humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage in preparation for the democratic convention johnson requested the fbi send a squad of agents to cover convention activities the objective of the squad was to inform the white house staff of any disruptive activities on the floor the squads focus narrowed upon the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp delegation which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state the squads activities also included wiretaps of martin luther kings room as well as the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core from beginning to end the squads assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other highranking officials in fact johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the mfdp and the segregationist delegation and he assigned humphrey the job of managing the problem the conventions credentials committee declared that two mfdp delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote by reason of their race or color the mfdp rejected the committees ruling the convention became the apparent personal triumph that johnson craved but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the mfdp would trigger disaffection with johnson and the democratic party from the left sncc chairman john lewis would call it a turning point in the civil rights movement early in the presidential campaign barry goldwater appeared to be a strong contender with strong support from the south which threatened johnsons position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the civil rights act however goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed on september johnsons campaign managers broadcast the daisy ad it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy counting up to ten then a baritone voice took over counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb the message conveyed was that electing goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war goldwaters campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming in your heart you know hes right opponents captured the spirit of johnsons campaign with bumper stickers that said in your heart you know he might and in your gut you know hes nuts johnson won the presidency by a landslide with percent of the vote making it the highest ever share of the popular vote at the time this was also the widest popular margin in the th centurymore than million votesthis was later surpassed by incumbent president nixons victory in in the electoral college johnson defeated goldwater by margin of to johnson won states compared to goldwaters six voters also gave johnson the largest majorities in congress since fdrs election in a senate with a majority and a house with a democratic margin johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office ready to carry forward the plans and programs of john fitzgerald kennedy not because of our sorrow or sympathy but because they are right he was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the civil rights act of and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out nevertheless the selma to montgomery marches in alabama led by martin luther king ultimately led johnson to initiate debate on a voting rights bill in february  johnson gave a congressional speechdallek considers it his greatestin which he said rarely at anytime does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itselfrarely are we met with the challenge to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue and should we defeat every enemy should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation in he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the voting rights act which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time in accordance with the act several states seven of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy alabama south carolina north carolina georgia louisiana mississippi virginia were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in while texas home to the majority of the african american population at the time followed in the senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of just after months and won passage in the house in july by the results were significantbetween the years of and the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled the act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationallyin a few hundred black officeholders mushroomed to in  after the murder of civil rights worker viola liuzzo johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four ku klux klansmen implicated in her death he angrily denounced the klan as a hooded society of bigots and warned them to return to a decent society before its too late johnson was the first president to arrest and prosecute members of the klan since ulysses s grant about years earlier he turned to themes of christian redemption to push for civil rights thereby mobilizing support from churches north and south at the howard university commencement address on june he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve goals to shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin to dissolve as best we can the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder divide the great democracy and do wronggreat wrongto the children of god in johnson nominated civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to be the first african american associate justice of the supreme court to head the new department of housing and urban development johnson appointed robert c weaverthe first africanamerican cabinet secretary in any us presidential administration in johnson signed the civil rights act of which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race creed or national origin the impetus for the laws passage came from the chicago open housing movement the april assassination of martin luther kingjr and the civil unrest across the country following kings death on april johnson wrote a letter to the united states house of representatives urging passage of the fair housing act with newly urgent attention from legislative director joseph califano and democratic speaker of the house john mccormack the bill which was previously stalled passed the house by a wide margin on april  with the passage of the sweeping immigration and nationality act of the countrys immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the s were removed the annual rate of inflow doubled between and and doubled again by with dramatic increases from asia and mexico scholars give johnson little credit for the law which was not one of his priorities he had supported the mccarrenwalters act of that was unpopular with reformers johnson whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in texas fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty and was an essential component of the american dream especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tightfisted budgets from local taxes he made education the top priority of the great society agenda with an emphasis on helping poor children after the landslide brought in many new liberal congressmen lbj launched a legislative effort which took the name of the elementary and secondary education act esea of the bill sought to double federal spending on education from billion to billion with considerable facilitating by the white house it passed the house by a vote of to on march and then it remarkably passed without change in the senate by to without going through the usual conference committee this was an historic accomplishment by the president with the billion dollar bill passing as introduced just days before for the first time large amounts of federal money went to public schools in practice esea meant helping all public school districts with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families which included all the big cities for the first time private schools most of them catholic schools in the inner cities received services such as library funding comprising about percent of the esea budget though federal funds were involved they were administered by local officials and by it was reported that less than half of the funds were actually applied toward the education of children under the poverty line dallek further reports that researchers cited by hugh davis graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by esea reading and math programs but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes johnsons second major education program was the higher education act of which focused on funding for lower income students including grants workstudy money and government loans he set up the national endowment for the humanities and the national endowment for the arts to support humanists and artists as the wpa once did although esea solidified johnsons support among k teachers unions neither the higher education act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in vietnam in johnson signed the public broadcasting act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks in at johnsons request congress passed the revenue act of and the economic opportunity act as part of the war on poverty johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as head start food stamps and work study during johnsons years in office national poverty declined significantly with the percentage of americans living below the poverty line dropping from percent to percent johnson took an additional step in the war on poverty with an urban renewal effort presenting to congress in january the demonstration cities program to be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city johnson requested an investment of million per year totaling billion in the fall of the congress passed a substantially reduced program costing million which johnson later called the model cities program changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill the new york times wrote years later that the program was for the most part a failure johnsons initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of the commission on heart disease cancer and strokes hdcs combined these diseases accounted for percent of the nations deaths in to enact recommendations of the commission johnson asked congress for funds to set up the regional medical program rmp to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice congress passed a significantly watered down version as a backup position in johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under social security the key player in initiating this program named medicare was wilbur mills chairman of the house ways and means committee in order to reduce republican opposition mills suggested that medicare be fashioned as a three layer cakehospital insurance under social security a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor known as medicaid the bill passed the house by a margin of votes on april the effort in the senate was considerably more complicated however the medicare bill passed congress on july after negotiation in a conference committee medicare now covers tens of millions of americans johnson gave the first two medicare cards to former president harry s truman and his wife bess after signing the medicare bill at the truman library in independence missouri in march johnson sent to congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new transportation departmentwhich would include the commerce departments office of transportation the bureau of public roads the federal aviation agency the coast guard the maritime administration the civil aeronautics board and the interstate commerce commission the bill passed the senate after some negotiation over navigation projects in the house passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed october  on october lyndon johnson signed the gun control act of one of the largest and farthestreaching federal gun control laws in american history much of the motivation for this large expansion of federal gun regulations came as a response to the assassinations of john f kennedy robert f kennedy and martin luther king jr during johnsons administration nasa conducted the gemini manned space program developed the saturn v rocket and its launch facility and prepared to make the first manned apollo program flights on january the nation was stunned when the entire crew of apollo was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad stopping apollo in its tracks rather than appointing another warrenstyle commission johnson accepted administrator james e webbs request for nasa to do its own investigation holding itself accountable to congress and the president johnson maintained his staunch support of apollo through congressional and press controversy and the program recovered the first two manned missions apollo and the first manned flight to the moon apollo were completed by the end of johnsons term he congratulated the apollo crew saying youve taken all of us all over the world into a new era on july johnson attended the launch of the first moon landing mission apollo becoming the first former or incumbent us president to witness a rocket launch major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of long hot summers they started with a violent disturbance in the harlem riots in and the watts district of los angeles in and extended to the momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of with the riots in watts after people were killed and million in property was damaged the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities and so the appetite for additional programs in lbjs agenda was lost the biggest wave of riots came in april in over a hundred cities after the assassination of martin luther king newark burned in where six days of rioting left dead injured and the inner city a burned out shell in detroit in governor george romney sent in national guard troops to quell fire bombings looting and attacks on businesses and on police johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally were dead were injured were arrested property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing but this fell on deaf ears johnsons popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape reinforcing the sense johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party johnson created the kerner commission to study the problem of urban riots headed by illinois governor otto kerner according to press secretary george christian johnson was unsurprised by the riots saying what did you expect i dont know why were so surprised when you put your foot on a mans neck and hold him down for three hundred years and then you let him up whats he going to do hes going to knock your block off in the press sensed a credibility gap between what johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in vietnam which led to much less favorable coverage by years end the democratic governor of missouri warren e hearnes warned that johnson would lose the state by votes despite winning by a margin in frustration over vietnam too much federal spending and taxation no great public support for your great society programs and public disenchantment with the civil rights programs had eroded the presidents standing the governor reported there were bright spots in january johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history unemployment was at a year low and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever a percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome as was the rise in interest rates johnson asked for a temporary percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending johnsons approval ratings stayed below percent by january the number of his strong supporters had plunged to from percent four months before he ran about even with republican george romney in trial matchups that spring asked to explain why he was unpopular johnson responded i am a dominating personality and when i get things done i dont always please all the people johnson also blamed the press saying they showed complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to he also blamed the preachers liberals and professors who had turned against him in the congressional elections of the republicans gained three seats in the senate and in the house reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for johnson to pass any additional great society legislation however in the end congress passed almost percent of the administrations great society programs which johnson then signed into law johnson subscribed to the domino theory in vietnam and to a containment policy that required america to make a serious effort to stop all communist expansion at kennedys death there were american military personnel in vietnam johnson immediately reversed kennedys order to withdraw military personnel by the end of he expanded the numbers and roles of the american military following the gulf of tonkin incident soon after the republican convention of  johnson in late summer seriously questioned the value of staying in vietnam but after meeting with secretary of state dean rusk and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff maxwell d taylor declared his readiness to do more when we had a base or when saigon was politically more stable in the presidential campaign he restated his determination to provide measured support for vietnam while avoiding another korea but privately he had a sense of foreboding about vietnama feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly indeed his heart was on his great society agenda and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his war on poverty the situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional viet minh attacks on us ships in the tonkin gulf as well as an attack on bien hoa airbase in south vietnam johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the joint chiefs and also after public pollster lou harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls by the end of there were approximately military personnel in south vietnam us casualties for totaled  in the winter of johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in south vietnam moreover a plurality in the polls at the time were in favor of military action against the communists with only to percent opposed johnson revised his priorities and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of january with yet another change of government in saigon he then agreed with mac bundy and mcnamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation johnson said stable government or no stable government in saigon we will do what we ought to do im prepared to do that we will move strongly general nguyn khnh head of the new government is our boy johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in february after a ground report from bundy recommending immediate us action to avoid defeat also the viet cong had just killed eight us advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at pleiku air base the eightweek bombing campaign became known as operation rolling thunder johnsons instructions for public consumption were clearthere was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded long term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that hanoi would rein in the viet cong to one of provoking hanoi and the viet cong into an intensification of the war but the shortterm expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the south vietnamese government would be bolstered by limiting the information given out to the public and even to congress johnson maximized his flexibility to change course in march bundy began to urge the use of ground forcesamerican air operations alone he counseled would not stop hanois aggression against the south johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of to the deployment of two additional marine battalions and a marine air squadron in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisionsand most importantly a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations nevertheless he disobligingly continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy in early johnson sent us marines to the dominican republic to protect the embassy there and to respond to yet another perceived communist threat by the escalating civil war that spring an agreement was reached at the urging of the oas and the us to end the uprising this crisis reinforced johnsons belief it was essential to convince supporters and opponents at home and abroad that he had an effective strategy to meet the communist challenge in vietnam after a conference of advisors in honolulu in april by the middle of june the total us ground forces in vietnam were increased to or by percent on may johnson told congressional leaders that he wanted an additional million for vietnam and the dominican republic saying each member of congress who supports this request is voting to continue our effort to try to hold communist aggression the request was approved by the house to and by the senate to in june ambassador taylor reported that the bombing offensive against north vietnam had been ineffective and that the south vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse gen westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from to after consulting with his principals johnson desirous of a low profile chose to announce at a press conference an increase to troops with additional forces to be sent later upon request in order to mute his announcement johnson at the same time announced the nomination of abe fortas to the supreme court and john chancellor as director of the voice of america johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choicesbetween sending americans to die in vietnam and giving in to the communists if he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached he continued to insist that his decision did not imply any change in policy whatsoever of his desire to veil the decision johnson jested privately if you have a motherinlaw with only one eye and she has it in the center of her forehead you dont keep her in the living room by october there were over troops deployed in vietnam polls showed that beginning in the public was consistently percent hawkish and percent dovish johnsons aides told him both hawks and doves are frustrated with the war and take it out on you politically johnson closely watched the public opinion polls his goal was not to adjust his policies to follow opinion but rather to adjust opinion to support his policies until the tet offensive of he systematically downplayed the war he made very few speeches about vietnam and held no rallies or parades or advertising campaigns he feared that publicity would charge up the hawks who wanted victory and weaken both his containment policy and his higher priorities in domestic issues jacobs and shapiro conclude although johnson held a core of support for his position the president was unable to move americans who held hawkish and dovish positions on april the current canadian prime minister lester b pearson gave a speech at temple university in philadelphia during his speech he voiced his support for a pause in the american bombing of north vietnam so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold to president johnson this criticism of american foreign policy on american soil was an intolerable sin before pearson had finished his speech he was summoned to camp david maryland to meet with johnson the next day johnson who was notorious for his personal touch in politics reportedly grabbed pearson by the lapels and shouted dont you come into my living room and piss on my rug at the end of after consultation with the joint chiefs and other advisers johnson decided to increase troops at the rate of per month throughout rather than increasing them at one time in order to avoid a more publicized increase at the same time there was deliberation over a bombing pause and johnson finally agreed on december to a pause and a corresponding peace offensive the pause in bombing and the peace blitz ended january without discernible effect disturbed by criticism of the war then underscored with public hearings by the senate foreign relations committee in january johnson convened a second honolulu conference and personally attended for three days along with ambassador lodge gen westmoreland the vietnamese chief of state nguyen van thieu and prime minister nguyen cao ky in april johnson was encouraged by statistics that the viet cong had suffered greater numbers of casualties than the south vietnamese at the same time despite urgings in honolulu to strengthen his internal affairs prime minister kys administration was increasingly vulnerable to rebel forces the administration pressured ky to hasten a transfer of power to an assembly but he demurred public as well as political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of at the time when johnsons approval ratings were reaching new lows of percent sen richard russell chairman of the armed services committee reflected the national mood in june when he declared it was time to get it over or get out johnson responded by saying to the press we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost in response to the intensified criticism of the war effort johnson employed the suspicion of communist subversion in the country and press relations became strained johnsons primary war policy opponent in congress included among others the chairman of the foreign relations committee james william fulbright the persistent johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum oil and lubrication facilities in north vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory humphrey rusk and mcnamara all agreed the bombing began the end of june in july polling results indicated that americans favored the bombing campaign by a to margin however in august a defense department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on north vietnam in the fall of however multiple sources began to report progress was being made against the north vietnamese logistics and infrastructure johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions there was no shortage of peace initiatives nevertheless among protesters english philosopher bertrand russell attacked johnsons policy as a barbaric aggressive war of conquest and in june he initiated the international war crimes tribunal as a means to condemn the american effort the gap with hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces in august johnson appointed averell harriman ambassador for peace to promote negotiations westmoreland and mcnamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification johnson formally placed this effort under military control in october also in october to reassure and promote his war effort johnson initiated a meeting with allies in manilathe south vietnamese thais south koreans filipinos australians and new zealanders the conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in vietnam and across asia for johnson it was a fleeting public relations successconfirmed by a percent vietnam approval rating in november nevertheless in december johnsons vietnam approval rating was again back down in the s lbj had become anxious to justify war casualties and talked of the need for decisive victory despite the unpopularity of the cause in a discussion about the war with former president dwight eisenhower on october johnson said he was trying to win it just as fast as i can in every way that i know how and later stated that he needed all the help i can get by years end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual as had been the air campaign johnson then agreed to mcnamaras new recommendation to add troops in to the previously committed while mcnamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing johnson agreed with cia recommendations to increase them the increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in saigon hanoi and warsaw while the bombing ended the talks north vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine january and february included probes to detect north vietnamese willingness to discuss peace and all fell on deaf ears ho chi minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the us corrected military estimates released in march indicated a greater number of enemyinitiated actions between february and this exemplified the unreliability of information coming from the ground in vietnam similar discrepancies existed in measuring the movement of supplies and forces from north to south and assessing viet cong manpower in february johnson nevertheless agreed to attacks on infiltration routes in laos and fiftyfour new targets in the north as well as the mining of inland waterways to complement bombing in march robert kennedy assumed a more public opposition to the war in a senate speech the fact of his opposition and probable candidacy for the presidency in according to dallek inhibited the embattled and embittered johnson from employing a more realistic war policy johnsons anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to kennedy johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer and warned kennedy ill destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months he shouted youll be dead politically in six months in june a decisive of the country said they had lost confidence in the presidents leadership mcnamara actually offered johnson a way out of vietnam in may the administration could declare its objective in the warsouth vietnams selfdeterminationwas being achieved and upcoming september elections in south vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government the united states could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome but johnson was reluctant in light of some optimistic reports again of questionable reliability which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope of improvement the cia was reporting wide food shortages in hanoi and an unstable power grid as well as military manpower reductions by the middle of nearly americans had been killed or wounded in the war in july johnson sent mcnamara wheeler and other officials to meet with westmoreland and reach agreement on plans for the immediate future at that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a stalemate westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction and that we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes though westmoreland sought many more johnson agreed to an increase of troops bringing the total to a gallup poll in july showed percent of the country disapproving of the presidents handling of the war and only percent thought progress was being made in august johnson with the joint chiefs support decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only hanoi haiphong and a buffer zone with china from the target list later that month mcnamara told a senate subcommittee that an expanded air campaign would not bring hanoi to the peace tablethe joint chiefs were astounded and threatened mass resignationmcnamara was summoned to the white house for a threehour dressing down nevertheless johnson had received reports from the cia confirming mcnamaras analysis at least in part in the meantime an election establishing a constitutional government in the south was concluded and provided hope for peace talks despite the election the south vietnam government remained incompetent and riddled with corruption but in september ho chi minh and north vietnamese premier pham van dong appeared amenable to french mediation so johnson ceased bombing in a mile zone around hanoi this was met with dissatisfaction johnson in a texas speech agreed to halt all bombing if ho chi minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if north vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt this was named the san antonio formula there was no response but johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause fellow democrat tip oneill joined the ranks of those opposed to the war in late and with the ever increasing public protests against the war in october johnson engaged the fbi and the cia to investigate monitor and undermine antiwar activists in midoctober there was a demonstration of at the pentagon johnson and rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration which was refuted by cia findings with the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict johnson convened a group called the wise men for a fresh indepth look at the wardean acheson gen omar bradley george ball mac bundy arthur dean douglas dillon abe fortas averell harriman henry cabot lodge robert murphy and max taylor at that time mcnamara reversing his position on the war recommended that a cap of be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted since he could see no success johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and described mcnamara as ready to pull another forrestal a reference to the suicide of former defense secretary james forrestal mcnamaras resignation soon followed with the exception of george ball the wise men all agreed the administration should press forward johnson was confident that hanoi would await the us election results before deciding to negotiate as casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever johnsons popularity plummeted college students and others protested burned draft cards and chanted hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests and was not allowed by the secret service to attend the democratic national convention where thousands of hippies yippies black panthers and other opponents of johnsons policies both in vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest thus by the public was polarized with the hawks rejecting johnsons refusal to continue the war indefinitely and the doves rejecting his current war policies support for johnsons middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement by late summer he realized that nixon was closer to his position than humphrey he continued to support humphrey publicly in the election and personally despised nixon one of johnsons well known quotes was the democratic party at its worst is still better than the republican party at its best on january came the viet cong and north vietnamese tet offensive against south vietnams five largest cities including saigon and the us embassy there and other government installations while the tet offensive failed militarily it was a psychological victory definitively turning american public opinion against the war effort iconically walter cronkite of cbs news voted the nations most trusted person in february expressed on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing johnson reacted saying if ive lost cronkite ive lost middle america indeed demoralization about the war was everywhere then approved of johnsons handling of vietnam disapproved johnson agreed to increase the troop level by despite a recommendation from the joint chiefs for ten times that number by march johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war clark clifford the new defense secretary described the war as a loser and proposed to cut losses and get out on march johnson spoke to the nation of steps to limit the war in vietnam he then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of north vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time at the close of his speech he also announced i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president in march johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that percent of north vietnams population and percent of its territory was offlimits to bombing in april he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site paris was agreed to and talks began in may when the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in paris two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive despite recommendations in august from harriman vance clifford and bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks johnson refused in october when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt republican presidential nominee richard nixon intervened with the south vietnamese and made promises of better terms so as to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election after the election johnsons primary focus on vietnam was to get saigon to join the paris peace talks ironically only after nixon added his urging did they do so even then they argued about procedural matters until after nixon took office a few analysts have theorized that vietnam had no independent impact on president johnsons popularity at all after other effects including a general overall downward trend in popularity had been taken into account the war grew less popular and continued to split the democratic party the republican party was not completely pro or antiwar and nixon managed to get support from both groups by running on a reduction in troop levels with an eye toward eventually ending the campaign johnson often privately cursed the vietnam war and in a conversation with robert mcnamara he assailed the bunch of commies running the new york times for their articles against the war effort in two weeks in may alone american deaths numbered with total casualties at alluding to the domino theory he said if we allow vietnam to fall tomorrow well be fighting in hawaii and next week in san franciscocitation needed johnson once summed up his perspective of the vietnam war as follows i knew from the start that i was bound to be crucified either way i moved if i left the woman i really lovedthe great societyin order to get involved in that bitch of a war on the other side of the world then i would lose everything at home all my programs but if i left that war and let the communists take over south vietnam then i would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser and we would both find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere on the entire globe biographers including dallek have said that johnson suffered agonizing decisions in the vietnam war and felt it caused divisions both in the us and abroad johnson was afraid that if he tried to defeat the north vietnamese regime with an invasion of north vietnam rather than simply try to protect south vietnam he might provoke the chinese to stage a fullscale military intervention similar to their intervention in during the korean war as well as provoke the soviets into launching a fullscale military invasion of western europe in a interview for the johnson presidential library oral history archives johnsons secretary of defense robert mcnamara stated that a carrier battle group the us th fleet sent on a training exercise toward gibraltar was repositioned back towards the eastern mediterranean to be able to assist israel during the sixday war of june given the rapid israeli advances following their strike on egypt the administration thought the situation was so tense in israel that perhaps the syrians fearing israel would attack them or the soviets supporting the syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack israel the soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move in a hotline message from moscow soviet premier alexei kosygin said if you want war youre going to get war the soviet union supported its arab allies in may the soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the east mediterranean early in the crisis they began to shadow the us and british carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels the soviet naval squadron in the mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the us navy in a interview with the boston globe mcnamara claimed that we damn near had war he said kosygin was angry that we had turned around a carrier in the mediterranean johnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency he flew miles aboard air force one while in office his october visit to australia sparked demonstrations from antiwar protesters one of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before christmas in the president began the trip by going to the memorial service for australian prime minister harold holt who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned the white house did not reveal in advance to the press that the president would make the first roundtheworld presidential trip the trip was miles completed in only hours days air force one crossed the equator twice stopped in travis air force base calif then honolulu pago pago canberra melbourne vietnam karachi and rome as he had served less than months of president kennedys term johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the presidential election under the provisions of the nd amendment initially no prominent democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the democratic party only senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota challenged johnson as an antiwar candidate in the new hampshire primary hoping to pressure the democrats to oppose the vietnam war on march mccarthy won percent of the primary vote to johnsons percent an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger four days later sen robert f kennedy of new york entered the race internal polling by johnsons campaign in wisconsin the next state to hold a primary election showed the president trailing badly johnson did not leave the white house to campaign by this time johnson had lost control of the democratic party which was splitting into four factions each of which generally disliked the other three the first consisted of johnson and humphrey labor unions and local party bosses led by chicago mayor richard j daley the second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind mccarthy the third group were catholics hispanics and african americans who rallied behind robert kennedy the fourth group were traditionally segregationist white southerners who rallied behind george c wallace and the american independent party vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party and johnson could see no way to win the war and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win reelection in addition although it was not made public at the time johnson became more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another fouryear term therefore at the end of a march speech he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for reelection by concluding with the line i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president the next day his approval ratings increased from to  historians have debated the factors that led to johnsons surprise decision shesol says johnson wanted out of the white house but also wanted vindication when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave gould says that johnson had neglected the party was hurting it by his vietnam policies and underestimated mccarthys strength until the very last minute when it was too late for johnson to recover woods said johnson realized he needed to leave in order for the nation to heal dallek says that johnson had no further domestic goals and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity his health was not good and he was preoccupied with the kennedy campaign his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker bennett however says johnson had been forced out of a reelection race in by outrage over his policy in southeast asia after robert kennedys assassination johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give humphrey the nomination at the democratic national convention personal correspondences between the president and some in the republican party suggested johnson tacitly supported nelson rockefellers campaign he reportedly said that if rockefeller became the republican nominee he would not campaign against him and would not campaign for humphrey in what was termed the october surprise johnson announced to the nation on october that he had ordered a complete cessation of all air naval and artillery bombardment of north vietnam effective november should the hanoi government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the paris peace talks in the end democrats did not fully unite behind humphrey enabling republican candidate richard nixon to win the election johnson appointed the following justices to the supreme court of the united states johnson in anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures and thought it advantageous to have a mole in the supreme court who he thought could provide him with inside information as he was able to get from the legislative branch abe fortas in particular was the individual that johnson thought could fill the bill the opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the un with adlai stevensons death associate justice arthur goldenberg accepted johnsons offer to transfer to the position only johnsons insistence as well as a slight of hand in fortas assuming goldbergs seat could overcome fortas wifes objection that it was too early in his career mrs fortas expressed unparalleled disapproval to johnson personally afterwards when earl warren announced his retirement in johnson nominated fortas to succeed him as chief justice of the united states and nominated homer thornberry to succeed fortas as associate justice however fortass nomination was filibustered by senators and neither nominee was voted upon by the full senate in addition to his supreme court appointments johnson appointed judges to the united states courts of appeals and judges to the united states district courts johnson also had a small number of judicial appointment controversies with one appellate and three district court nominees not being confirmed by the united states senate before johnsons presidency ended johnson continued the fbis wiretapping of martin luther king jr that had been previously authorized by the kennedy administration under attorney general robert kennedy as a result of listening to the fbis tapes remarks on kings extramarital activities were made by several prominent officials including johnson who once said that king was a hypocritical preacher johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others including the vietnamese friends of a nixon associate during his presidency johnson issued pardons and commutations granting over percent of such requests according to biographer radall woods johnson posed in many different roles depending on the circumstances he could be other historians have noted how he played additional roles as kent germany reports johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious tireless and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed he worked to hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities there was no more powerful majority leader in american history biographer robert dallek writes dallek stated that johnson had biographies on all the senators knew what their ambitions hopes and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes another johnson biographer noted he could get up every day and learn what their fears their desires their wishes their wants were and he could then manipulate dominate persuade and cajole them at feet inches m tall johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion known as the johnson treatment a contemporary writes it was an incredible blend of badgering cajolery reminders of past favors promises of future favors predictions of gloom if something doesnt happen when that man started to work on you all of a sudden you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you johnsons cowboy hat and boots reflected his texas roots and genuine love of the rural hill country from acres ha of land that he was given by an aunt in he created a acre ha working ranch with head of registered hereford cattle the national park service keeps a herd of hereford cattle descended from johnsons registered herd and maintains the ranch property biographer randall woods argues that social gospel themes johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems this helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice as exemplified by the great society and his commitment to racial equality the social gospel explicitly inspired his foreignpolicy approach to a sort of christian internationalism and nation building for example in a speech he quoted at length from the social creed of the methodist church issued in adding it would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the american ideal after leaving the presidency in january johnson went home to his ranch in stonewall texas accompanied by former aide and speech writer harry j middleton who would draft johnsons first book the choices we face and work with him on his memoirs entitled the vantage point perspectives of the presidency published in that year the lyndon baines johnson library and museum opened on the campus of the university of texas at austin he donated his texas ranch in his will to the public to form the lyndon b johnson national historical park with the provision that the ranch remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past johnson gave nixon high grades in foreign policy but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing us forces too quickly before the south vietnamese were really able to defend themselves if the south falls to the communists we can have a serious backlash here at home he warned during the presidential election johnson endorsed democratic presidential nominee george s mcgovern a senator from south dakota although mcgovern had long opposed johnsons foreign and defense policies the mcgovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him nixon could be defeated if only the democrats dont go too far left he had insisted johnson had felt edmund muskie would be more likely to defeat nixon however he declined an invitation to try to stop mcgovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help mcgovern johnsons protg john connally had served as president nixons secretary of the treasury and then stepped down to head democrats for nixon a group funded by republicans it was the first time that connally and johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign in march johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to brooke army general hospital on fort sam houston in san antonio he was urged to lose a considerable amount of weight johnson had grown dangerously heavier since leaving the white house gaining more than pounds kg and weighing around pounds kg he had also resumed smoking after nearly fifteen years without having done so which contributed further to his health problems the following summer again gripped by chest pains he embarked on a crash water diet shedding about pounds kg in less than a month in april johnson fell victim to a second heart attack while visiting his daughter lynda in charlottesville virginia im hurting real bad he confided to friends the chest pains hit him nearly every afternoona series of sharp jolting pains that left him scared and breathless a portable oxygen tank stood next to his bed and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask to gulp air he continued to smoke heavily and although placed on a lowcalorie lowcholesterol diet kept to it only in fits and starts meanwhile he began experiencing severe stomach pains doctors diagnosed this problem as diverticulosis pouches forming on the intestine his condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended so johnson flew to houston to consult with heart specialist dr michael debakey debakey discovered that even though two of the former presidents coronary arteries were critically damaged the overall condition of his heart was so poor that even attempting a bypass surgery would likely result in fatal complications on inauguration day january johnson saw nixon sworn in then got on the plane to fly back to texas when the front door of the plane closed johnson pulled out a cigarettehis first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in one of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said daddy what are you doing youre going to kill yourself he took it back and said ive now raised you girls ive now been president now its my time from that point on he went into a very selfdestructive spiral with his condition now diagnosed as terminal johnson returned home to his ranch at approximately pm central time on january johnson placed a call to the ranchs secret service compound complaining of massive chest pains the agents rushed to the former presidents bedroom finding him unresponsive with the phone receiver still in his hand johnson was airlifted in one of his own airplanes to san antonio and taken to brooke army general where he was pronounced dead on arrival at the facility by cardiologist and army colonel dr george mcgranahan johnson who died two days after richard nixons second inauguration was the second former president to die within the span of two months at the time of his death former president harry s truman whose death made johnson the only living former president died less than a month before johnson did on december johnsons death left the united states with no living former presidents he and truman had been the only two since dwight eisenhowers death in  shortly after johnsons death his press secretary tom johnson no relation telephoned walter cronkite at cbs cronkite was live on the air with the cbs evening news at the time and a report on vietnam was cut abruptly while cronkite was still on the line so he could break the news johnson was honored with a state funeral in which texas congressman j j pickle and former secretary of state dean rusk eulogized him at the capitol the final services took place on january the funeral was held at the national city christian church in washington dc where he had often worshiped as president the service was presided over by president richard nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries led by former japanese prime minister eisaku sat who served as japanese prime minister during johnsons presidency eulogies were given by the rev dr george davis the churchs pastor and w marvin watson former postmaster general nixon did not speak though he attended as is customary for presidents during state funerals but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes as rusk did the day before as nixon mentioned johnsons death in a speech he gave the day after johnson died announcing the peace agreement to end the vietnam war johnson was buried in his family cemetery which although it is part of the lyndon b johnson national historical park in stonewall texas is still privately owned by the johnson family who have requested that the public not enter the cemetery a few yards from the house in which he was born eulogies were given by john connally and the rev billy graham the minister who officiated the burial rites the state funeral the last for a president until ronald reagans in was part of an unexpectedly busy week in washington as the military district of washington mdw dealt with their second major task in less than a week beginning with nixons second inauguration the inauguration had an impact on the state funeral in various ways because johnson died only two days after the inauguration the mdw and the armed forces inaugural committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration to allow for a full state funeral and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral it also meant johnsons casket traveled the entire length of the capitol entering through the senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exited through the house wing steps due to construction on the east front steps the manned spacecraft center in houston was renamed the lyndon b johnson space center in and texas created a legal state holiday to be observed on august to

representative ileana roslehtinen he also worked on republican senator bob doles presidential campaign in april two years out of law school and years old rubio was elected to a seat as city commissioner for west miami before moving on to the florida house of representatives in early  in october newspapers reported that rubios previous statements that his parents were forced to leave cuba in after fidel castro came to power were embellishments his parents actually left cuba in during the dictatorship of fulgencio batista according to the washington post many voters in florida would be less impressed by his family being economic migrants instead of political refugees from a communist regime rubio responded saying the essence of my family story is why they came to america in the first place and why they had to stay aside from rubios maternal grandfather who fled communist cuba in several other relatives were also admitted to the us as refugees in late a special election was called to fill the seat for the th house district in the florida house of representatives representing miami the seat had been held by representative carlos valdes who had run for and won an open florida state senate seat it was considered a safe republican seat so rubios main challenge was to win the gop nomination he campaigned as a moderate advocating tax cuts and early childhood education rubio placed second in the republican primary on december but won the runoff election for the republican nomination defeating angel zayon a television and radio reporter who was popular with cuban exiles by just votes he then defeated democrat anastasia garcia with of the vote in a january special election in november rubio won reelection unopposed in he won reelection to a second full term

the florida legislative session officially lasted only days he was able to spend about half of each year in miami where he worked first at a law firm that specialized in land use and zoning and later starting in took a position with broad and cassel a miami law and lobbying firm though state law precluded him from engaging in lobbying or introducing legislation on behalf of the firms clients at the time rubio took his seat in the legislature in tallahassee in january voters in florida had recently approved a constitutional amendment on term limits this created openings for new legislative leaders due to many senior incumbents having to retire according to an article in national journal rubio also gained an extra advantage in that regard because he was sworn in early due to the special election and he would take advantage of these opportunities to join the gop leadership later in the majority leader of the house mike fasano promoted rubio to be one of two majority whips national journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of armtwisting but said rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them fasano resigned in september as majority leader of the house due to disagreements with the house speaker and the speaker passed over rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for fasano rubio volunteered to work on redistricting which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions then working individually with the lawmakers involved and this work helped to cement his relationships with gop leaders in december rubio was appointed house majority leader by speaker johnnie byrd he persuaded speaker byrd to restructure the job of majority leader so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whips office and rubio would become the main spokesperson for the house gop according to national journal during this period rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles and some colleagues described him as a centrist who sought out democrats and groups that dont typically align with the gop he cosponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay and cosponsored a bill for giving instate tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants in the wake of the september attacks he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers and helped defeat a gop bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students as a state representative rubio requested legislative earmarks called community budget issue requests in florida totaling about million for and but none thereafter additionally an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators including rubio as did the nonprofit group florida taxwatch many of those listed items were for health and social programs that rubio has described as the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didnt fund them a report by the tampa bay times and miami herald said that some of rubios spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests for example rubio requested a million appropriation for jackson memorial hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured and rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant a spokesman for rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county that rubio did not lobby to get them approved that the hospital money was necessary and noncontroversial and that rubio is a limitedgovernment conservative not a nogovernment conservative on september at the age of rubio clinched the speakership after state representatives dennis baxley jeff kottkamp and dennis a ross dropped out he was actually sworn in over a year later in november he became the first cuban american to be speaker of the florida house of representatives and would remain speaker until november  when he was chosen as future speaker in rubio delivered a speech to the house in which he asked members to look in their desks where they each found a hardcover book titled innovative ideas for floridas future but the book was intentionally blank because it had not yet been written and rubio told his colleagues that they would fill in the pages together with the help of ordinary floridians in after traveling around the state and talking with citizens and compiling their ideas rubio published the book the national journal called this book the centerpiece of rubios early speakership about of the ideas became law while another were partially enacted among the items from his book that became law were multipleyear car registrations a requirement that high schools provide more vocational courses and an expanded voucherlike schoolchoice program rubios defenders and even some critics point out that nationwide economic difficulties overlapped with much of rubios speakership and so funding new legislative proposals became difficult at the time rubio took office as speaker jeb bush was completing his term as governor and bush left office in january rubio hired bush aides leading capitol insiders to say the speakers suite was the governors office in exile an article in national journal described rubios style as being very different from bushs where bush was a very assertive manager of affairs in tallahassee the article says rubios style was to delegate certain powers relinquish others and invite former political rivals into his inner circle as incoming speaker he decided to open a private dining room for legislators which he said would give members more privacy free from being pursued by lobbyists though the expense of doing so led to a public relations problem in florida enacted into law limitations upon the authority of the state government to take private property in response to the supreme court decision in kelo v city of new london which took a broad view of governmental power to take private property under eminent domain this state legislation had been proposed by a special committee chaired by rubio prior to his speakership jeb bushs successor as governor was charlie crist a moderate republican who took office in january rubio and crist clashed frequently their sharpest clash involved the governors initiative to expand casino gambling in florida rubio sued crist for bypassing the florida legislature in order to make a deal with the seminole tribe the florida supreme court sided with rubio and blocked the deal rubio also was a critic of crists strategy to fight climate change through an executive order creating new automobile and utility emissions standards rubio accused crist of imposing europeanstyle big government mandates and the legislature under rubios leadership weakened the impact of crists climate change initiative rubio said that crists approach would harm consumers by driving up utility bills without having much effect upon the environment and that a better approach would be to promote biofuel eg ethanol solar panels and energy efficiency rubio introduced a plan to reduce state property taxes to levels and potentially eliminate them altogether while increasing sales taxes by to to fund schools the proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by billion his proposal passed the house but was opposed by governor crist and florida senate republicans who said that the increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor so rubio agreed to smaller changes and crists proposal to double the states property tax exemption from to for a tax reduction estimated by crist to be billion ultimately passed legislators called it the largest tax cut in floridas history up until then at the time republican antitax activist grover norquist described rubio as the most protaxpayer legislative leader in the country as speaker rubio aggressively tried to push florida to the political right according to nbc news and frequently clashed with the florida senate which was run by more moderate republicans and with thengovernor charlie crist a centrist republican at the time although a conservative behind the scenes many democrats considered rubio someone with whom they could work according to biographer manuel roigfranzia dan gelber of miami the house democratic leader at the time of rubios speakership considered him a true conservative but not a reflexive partisan saying he didnt have an objection to working with the other side simply because they were the other side to put it bluntly he wasnt a jerk gelber considered rubio a severe conservative really far to the right but probably the most talented spokesman the severe right could ever hope for while speaker of the florida house rubio shared a residence in tallahassee with another florida state representative david rivera which the two coowned the house later went into foreclosure in after several missed mortgage payments at that point rubio assumed responsibility for the payments and the house was eventually sold in florida state senator tony hill djacksonville chairman of the state legislatures black caucus requested that the legislature apologize for slavery and rubio said the idea merited discussion the following year a supportive rubio said such apologies can be important albeit symbolic he pointed out that even in young africanamerican males believe that the american dream is not available to them he helped set up a council on issues facing black men and boys persuaded colleagues to replicate the harlem childrens zone in the miami neighborhood of liberty city and supported efforts to promote literacy and mentoring for black children and others in during rubios senate campaign and again in during his presidential campaign issues were raised by the media and his political opponents about some items charged by rubio to his republican party of florida american express card during his time as house speaker rubio charged about during those two years of which was personal expenses unrelated to party business such as groceries and plane tickets rubio said that he personally paid american express more than for these personal expenses in the florida commission on ethics cleared rubio of wrongdoing in his use of the partyissued credit card although the commission inspector said that rubio exhibited a level of negligence in not using his personal mastercard in november rubio released his party credit card statements for january through october which showed eight personal charges totaling all of which he had personally reimbursed in most instances by the next billing period when releasing the charge records rubio spokesman todd harris said these statements are more than years old and the only people who ask about them today are the liberal media and our political opponents we are releasing them now because marco has nothing to hide after leaving the florida legislature in rubio started his own law firm and also began teaching under a fellowship appointment at florida international university fiu as an adjunct professor in he rejoined the fiu faculty after entering the us senate and he has taught on most mondays and fridays when the senate is usually not in session rubio teaches in the department of politics and international relations which is part of fius steven j green school of international and public affairs he has taught up to four undergraduate courses per year on florida politics political parties and legislative politics rubios reviews from students have been positive even from students who disagree with him politically he generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such rubio says that he wants students when they watch the news to have an appreciation for what is really going on behind the scenes and says that teaching forces me to stop sometimes and analyze things as of rubios appointment as an fiu professor is no longer a matter of partisan criticism though it was initially the university obtained considerable state funding when rubio was speaker of the florida house but many other university jobs were being eliminated due to funding issues at the time fiu appointed him to the faculty according to news reporting about rubios speakership he might have helped fiu get money early but all the projects already had been scheduled for funding by the states board of governors the president of the faculty senate at the time criticized the appointment and charlie crist raised the issue against rubio during the us senate election rubio spokesman alex burgos said that the position was approved in advance by the senate ethics committee which was then led by barbara boxer the director of fius school of international and public affairs says that rubio brings a great deal of insight and handson knowledge of the political process to the classroomour students will learn from a sitting us senator which is an incredible opportunity when rubio accepted the fellowship appointment as an adjunct professor at fiu he agreed to raise most of the funding for his position from private sources billionaire norman braman also a major campaign donor to rubio donated to finance the teaching position rubios office says that other senators such as thensenator joe biden have held teaching positions during their terms of office on may rubio announced on his website that he planned to run for the united states senate seat being vacated by mel martnez who had announced that he would not seek reelection martinez subsequently announced in august that he would resign before completing his term and upon his resignation was replaced by george lemieux prior to making his may announcement rubio had been meeting with fundraisers and supporters throughout the state initially trailing by doubledigits in the primary against the incumbent governor of his own party charlie crist rubio eventually surpassed crist in polling for the republican nomination in his campaign rubio received the support of

revbillycom stated that he made certain decisions regarding the closure of daycare centers across the city for political reasons according to the national assessment of educational performance fourthgrade reading scores from through rose nationally by points however on may the new york times reported according to the test naep new york city eighth graders have shown no significant improvement in math or reading since they began taking it in mirroring the largely flat performance of american eighth graders as a whole during that period in the city the lack of improvement held true across ethnic groups and also among lowerincome students somewho have seen this approach to the new york education system as largely unsuccessful because of skewed numbers under the reformed approach a school must do better than the previous year to receive funding because of this requirement many successful schools were closed for being unsuccessful because of their inability to raise test scores even though they were the top performing schools while many unsuccessful schools received the bulk of funding for simply raising their scores slightly bloomberg has chosen to apply a statistical resultsbased approach to city management appointing city commissioners based on their expertise and granting them wide autonomy in their decisionmaking breaking with years of tradition he implemented what new york times political reporter adam nagourney called a bullpen open office plan similar to a wall street trading floor in which dozens of aides and managerial staff are seated

was postponed later that day in the rescheduled primary bloomberg defeated herman badillo a former congressman to become the republican nominee meanwhile the democratic primary did not produce a firstround winner after a runoff the democratic nomination went to new york city public advocate mark j green in the general election bloomberg received giulianis endorsement he also had a huge spending advantage although new york citys campaign finance law restricts the amount of contributions which a candidate can accept bloomberg chose not to use public campaign funds and therefore his campaign was not subject to these restrictions he spent million of his own money on his campaign outspending green five to one one of the major themes of his campaign was that with the citys economy suffering from the effects of the world trade center attacks it needed a mayor with business experience in addition to serving as the republican nominee bloomberg had the ballot line of the controversial independence party in which social therapy leaders fred newman and lenora fulani exert strong influence some say that endorsement was important as bloombergs votes on that line exceeded his margin of victory over green under new yorks fusion rules a candidate can run on more than one partys line and combine all the votes received on all lines green the democrat also had the ballot line of the working families party he also created an independent line called students first whose votes were combined with those on the independence line another factor was the vote in staten island

percent bloombergs election marked the first time in new york city history that two different republicans had been elected mayor consecutively new york city has not been won by a republican in a

spent almost million on his campaign exceeding the record of million he spent on the previous election in late or early bloomberg gave the independence party of new york to fund a phone bank seeking to recruit volunteers for his reelection campaign former bronx borough president fernando ferrer won the democratic nomination to oppose bloomberg in the general election thomas ognibene sought to run against bloomberg in the republican partys primary election bloombergs campaign successfully challenged enough of the signatures ognibene had submitted to the board of elections to prevent ognibene from appearing on ballots for the republican primary instead ognibene ran only on the conservative party ticket ognibene accused bloomberg of betraying republican party ideals a feeling echoed by others bloomberg opposed the confirmation of john roberts as chief justice of the united states though a republican at the time bloomberg is a staunch supporter of abortion rights and did not believe

board on october the city council voted in favor of extending the term limit to three consecutive fouryear terms thus allowing bloomberg to run for office again after two days of public hearings bloomberg signed the bill into law on november  bloombergs bid for a third term generated some controversy civil libertarians such as former new york civil liberties union director norman siegel and new york civil rights coalition executive director michael meyers joined with local politicians such as new york state senator eric adams to protest the term limits extension bloombergs opponent was democratic and working families party nominee bill thompson who had been new york city comptroller for the past eight years and before that president of the new york city board of education bloomberg defeated thompson by a vote of to  after the release of independence party campaign filings in january it was reported that bloomberg had made two contributions from his personal account to the independence party on october and november the independence party then paid of that money to republican party political operative john haggerty jr this prompted an investigation beginning in february by the office of new york county district attorney cyrus vance jr into possible improprieties the independence party later questioned how haggerty spent the money which was to go to pollwatchers former new york state senator martin connor contended that because the bloomberg donations were made to an independence party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns this was a violation of campaign finance laws haggerty also spent money from a separate donation from bloomberg on office space on september bloomberg announced that he would not endorse any of then current candidates to succeed him on his radio show he stated i dont want to do anything that complicates it for the next mayor and thats one of the reasons ive decided im just not going to make an

initially in the new york magazine interview that he considered de blasios campaign racist and when asked about his comment bloomberg explained what he meant by his remark well no no i mean hes making

tagline new yorkers need a mayor not a nanny others have pointed out the fact that the smoking rate has dropped quickly during bloombergs time in office which has involved the banning of smoking in

campaigns around the united states in one example virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli and kentucky senator rand paul brought big gulps to a joint appearance for cuccinellis ultimately unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign to symbolize bloombergs efforts to restrict soft drink sales criticizing the mayor for wanting to buy the governors office down here a reference to progun control

have to change bloomberg characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative for turning the citys billion deficit into a billion surplus however conservative pac club for growth has criticized him because he increased property taxes and spending while doing so being a fiscal conservative is not about slashing programs that help the poor or improve health care or ensure a social safety net its about insisting services are provided efficiently get to only the people that need them and achieve the desired results fiscal conservatives have hearts too but we also insist on using our brains and that means demanding results and holding government accountable for producing them to me fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets not running deficits that the next generation cant afford it means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less it means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget and only in combination with spending cuts it means when you run a surplus you save it you dont squander it and most importantly being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns and by all indications weve got one coming bloomberg has expressed a distaste of taxes stating taxes are not good things but if you want services somebodys got to pay for

reported by the federal bureau of investigation to those utilized by such regimes as nazi germany the soviet union and the khmer rouge when you read some of the graphic descriptions of what has occurred here i almost hesitate to put them in the record and yet they have to be added to this debate let me read to you what one fbi agent saw and i quote from his report on a couple of occasions i entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor with no chair food or water most times they urinated or defecated on themselves and had been left there for hours or more on one occasion the air conditioning had been turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the room that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold on another occasion the air conditioner had been turned off making the temperature in the unventilated room well over degrees the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him he had apparently been literally pulling his hair out throughout the night on another occasion not only was the temperature unbearably hot but extremely loud rap music was being played in the room and had been since the day before with the detainee chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile floor if i read this to you and did not tell you that it was an fbi agent describing what americans had done to prisoners in their control you would most certainly believe this must have been done by nazis soviets in their gulags or some mad regime pol pot or others that had no concern for human beings sadly that is not the case this was the action of americans in the treatment of their prisoners durbins comments drew widespread criticism that comparing us actions to such regimes

illinois senator everett dirksen on the campaign trail eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate in midseptember the republican ticket faced a major crisis the media reported that nixon had a political fund maintained by his backers which reimbursed him for political expenses such a fund was not illegal but it exposed nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest with pressure building for eisenhower to demand nixons resignation from the ticket the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on september the address later termed the checkers speech was heard by about million americansincluding the largest television audience up to that point nixon emotionally defended himself stating that the fund was not secret nor had donors received special favors he painted himself as a man of modest means his wife had no mink coat instead she wore a respectable republican cloth coat and a patriot the speech would be remembered for the gift which nixon had received but which he would not give back a little cocker spaniel dog sent all the way from texas and our little girltricia the yearoldnamed it checkers the speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for nixon eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket which proved victorious in the november election eisenhower gave nixon responsibilities during his term as vice presidentmore than any previous vice president nixon attended cabinet and national security council meetings and chaired them when eisenhower was absent a tour of the far east succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the united states and prompted nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center he visited saigon and hanoi in french indochina on his return to the united states at the end of nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations biographer irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional years said of his vice presidency eisenhower radically altered the role of his running mate by presenting him with critical assignments in both foreign and domestic affairs once he assumed his office the vice president welcomed the presidents initiatives and worked energetically to accomplish white house objectives because of the collaboration between these two leaders nixon deserves the title the first modern vice president despite intense campaigning by nixon who reprised his strong attacks on the democrats the republicans lost control of both houses of congress in the elections these losses caused nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term on september president eisenhower suffered a heart attack his condition was initially believed to be lifethreatening eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks the th amendment to the united states constitution had not yet been proposed and the vice president had no formal power to act nonetheless nixon acted in eisenhowers stead during this period presiding over cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and cabinet officers did not seek power according to nixon biographer stephen ambrose nixon had earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis he made no attempt to seize power his spirits buoyed nixon sought a second term but some of eisenhowers aides aimed to displace him in a december meeting eisenhower proposed that nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a presidential run and instead become a cabinet officer in a second eisenhower administration nixon however believed such an action would destroy his political career when eisenhower announced his reelection bid in february he hedged on the choice of his running mate stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated although no republican was opposing eisenhower nixon received a substantial number of writein votes against the president in the new hampshire primary election in late april the president announced that nixon would again be his running mate eisenhower and nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the november election in the spring of nixon undertook another major foreign trip this time to africa on his return he helped shepherd the civil rights act of through congress the bill was weakened in the senate and civil rights leaders were divided over whether eisenhower should sign it nixon advised the president to sign the bill which he did eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in november and nixon gave a press conference assuring the nation that the cabinet was functioning well as a team during eisenhowers brief illness on april richard and pat nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of south america in montevideo uruguay nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus where he fielded questions from students on us foreign policy the trip was uneventful until the nixon party reached lima peru where he was met with student demonstrations nixon went to the campus got out of his car to confront the students and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects at his hotel nixon faced another mob and one demonstrator spat on him in caracas venezuela nixon and his wife were spat on by antiamerican demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipewielding mob according to ambrose nixons courageous conduct caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect in july president eisenhower sent nixon to the soviet union for the opening of the american national exhibition in moscow on july while touring the exhibits with soviet premier nikita khrushchev the two stopped at a model of an american kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the kitchen debate in nixon launched his first campaign for president of the united states he faced little opposition in the republican primaries and chose former massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge jr as his running mate his democratic opponent was john f kennedy and the race remained close for the duration nixon campaigned on his experience but kennedy called for new blood and claimed the eisenhowernixon administration had allowed the soviet union to overtake the us in ballistic missiles the missile gap a new political medium was introduced in the campaign televised presidential debates in the first of four such debates nixon appeared pale with a five oclock shadow in contrast to the photogenic kennedy nixons performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television though many people listening on the radio thought that nixon had won nixon lost the election narrowly with kennedy ahead by only votes percent in the popular vote there were charges of vote fraud in texas and illinois both states won by kennedy nixon refused to consider contesting the election feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the united states in the eyes of the world and the uncertainty would hurt us interests at the end of his term of office as vice president in january nixon and his family returned to california where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book six crises which included coverage of the hiss case eisenhowers heart attack and the fund crisis which had been resolved by the checkers speech local and national republican leaders encouraged nixon to challenge incumbent pat brown for governor of california in the election despite initial reluctance nixon entered the race the campaign was clouded by public suspicion that nixon viewed the office as a steppingstone for another presidential run some opposition from the farright of the party and his own lack of interest in being californias governor nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nations leading active republican politician and ensure he remained a major player in national politics instead he lost to brown by more than five percentage points and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent saying you wont have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is my last press conference the california defeat was highlighted in the november episode of abcs howard k smith news and comment entitled the political obituary of richard m nixon alger hiss appeared on the program and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president the furor drove smith and his program from the air and public sympathy for nixon grew the nixon family traveled to europe in where nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited the family moved to new york city where nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm nixon mudge rose guthrie alexander nixon had pledged when announcing his california campaign not to run for president in even if he had not he believed it would be difficult to defeat kennedy or after his assassination kennedys successor lyndon johnson in he supported arizona senator barry goldwater for the republican nomination for president when goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention although he thought goldwater unlikely to win nixon campaigned for him loyally the election was a disaster for the republicans goldwaters landslide loss to johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in congress and among state governors nixon was one of the few leading republicans not blamed for the disastrous results and he sought to build on that in the congressional elections he campaigned for many republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the johnson landslide and received credit for helping the republicans make major gains in the midterm election at the end of nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time although pat nixon did not always enjoy public life for example she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the checkers speech she was supportive of her husbands ambitions nixon believed that with the democrats torn over the issue of the vietnam war a republican had a good chance of winning although he expected the election to be as close as in  one of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the tet offensive was launched followed by the withdrawal of president johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the new hampshire primary it concluded with the assassination of one of the democratic candidates senator robert f kennedy just moments after his victory in the california primary on the republican side nixons main opposition was michigan governor george romney though new york governor nelson rockefeller and california governor ronald reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate a choice which nixon believed would unite the party appealing to both northern moderates and southerners disaffected with the democrats nixons democratic opponent in the general election was vice president hubert humphrey who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests throughout the campaign nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval he appealed to what he later called the silent majority of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the antiwar demonstrators agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups solidifying nixons position with the right nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign meeting with supporters in front of cameras he stressed that the crime rate was too high and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the democrats of the united states nuclear superiority nixon promised peace with honor in the vietnam war and proclaimed that new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the pacific he did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war resulting in media intimations that he must have a secret plan his slogan of nixons the one proved to be effective johnsons negotiators hoped to reach a truce in vietnam prior to the election nixon received astute analysis on the talks from henry kissinger then a consultant to us negotiator averell harriman and his campaign was in regular contact with anna chennault in saigon she advised south vietnamese president thieu not to go to paris to join the talks hinting that nixon would give him a better deal if elected johnson was aware of what was going on as he had both chennault and the south vietnamese ambassador to washington bugged and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by nixon to undermine us foreign policy on october with no agreement johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing and that peace negotiations would start in paris on november the day after election day on november after speaking with chennault again thieu stated he would not go to paris johnson telephoned nixon who denied any involvement the president did not believe him johnson felt he could not publicly mention chennaults involvement which had been obtained by wiretapping but told humphrey who chose not to use the information in a threeway race between nixon humphrey and independent candidate former alabama governor george wallace nixon defeated humphrey by nearly votes seventenths of a percentage point with electoral votes to for humphrey and for wallace in his victory speech nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together nixon said i have received a very gracious message from the vice president congratulating me for winning the election i congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds i also told him that i know exactly how he felt i know how it feels to lose a close one nixon was inaugurated as president on january sworn in by his onetime political rival chief justice earl warren pat nixon held the family bibles open at isaiah which reads they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks in his inaugural address which received almost uniformly positive reviews nixon remarked that the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemakera phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone he spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to china even before he became president writing in foreign affairs a year before his election there is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation assisting him in this venture was his national security advisor and future secretary of state henry kissinger with whom the president worked closely bypassing cabinet officials with relations between the soviet union and china at a nadirborder clashes between the two took place during nixons first year in officenixon sent private word to the chinese that he desired closer relations a breakthrough came in early when chairman mao invited a team of american table tennis players to visit china and play against top chinese players nixon followed up by sending kissinger to china for clandestine meetings with chinese officials on july it was simultaneously announced by beijing and by nixon on television and radio that the president would visit china the following february the announcements astounded the world the secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact in february nixon and his wife traveled to china kissinger briefed nixon for over hours in preparation upon touching down the president and first lady emerged from air force one and greeted chinese premier zhou enlai nixon made a point of shaking zhous hand something which thensecretary of state john foster dulles had refused to do in when the two met in geneva over television journalists accompanied the president on nixons orders television was strongly favored over printed publications as nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print it also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised nixon and kissinger met for an hour with mao and zhou at maos official private residence where they discussed a range of issues mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by nixon whom he considered forthright unlike the leftists and the soviets he said he was suspicious of kissinger though the national security advisor referred to their meeting as his encounter with history a formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the great hall of the people the following day nixon met with zhou the joint communique following this meeting recognized taiwan as a part of china and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification when not in meetings nixon toured architectural wonders including the forbidden city ming tombs and the great wall americans received their first glimpse into chinese life through the cameras which accompanied pat nixon who toured the city of beijing and visited communes schools factories and hospitals the visit ushered in a new era of sinoamerican relations fearing the possibility of a sinoamerican alliance the soviet union yielded to pressure for dtente with the united states when nixon took office about american soldiers were dying each week in vietnam and the war was broadly unpopular in the united states with violent protests against the war ongoing the johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions but this agreement never fully took force according to walter isaacson soon after taking office nixon had concluded that the vietnam war could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly conversely black argues that nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate north vietnam through the madman theory nixon sought some arrangement which would permit american forces to withdraw while leaving south vietnam secure against attack nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of north vietnamese and allied khmer rouge positions in cambodia in march codenamed operation menu a policy begun under johnson these operations resulted in heavy bombing of cambodia by one measurement more bombs were dropped over cambodia under johnson and nixon than the allies dropped during world war ii in mid nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders and peace talks began in paris initial talks however did not result in an agreement in may he publicly proposed to withdraw all american troops from south vietnam provided north vietnam also did so and for south vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with viet cong participation in july nixon visited south vietnam where he met with his us military commanders and president nguyn vn thiu amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout he implemented a strategy of replacing american troops with vietnamese troops known as vietnamization he soon instituted phased us troop withdrawals but authorized incursions into laos in part to interrupt the ho chi minh trail used to supply north vietnamese forces that passed through laos and cambodia nixon announced the ground invasion of cambodia to the american public on april his responses to protesters included an impromptu early morning meeting with them at the lincoln memorial on may documents uncovered from the soviet archives after reveal that the north vietnamese attempt to overrun cambodia in was launched at the explicit request of the khmer rouge and negotiated by pol pots thensecondincommand nuon chea nixons campaign promise to curb the war contrasted with the escalated bombing led to claims that nixon had a credibility gap on the issue in excerpts from the pentagon papers which had been leaked by daniel ellsberg were published by the new york times and the washington post when news of the leak first appeared nixon was inclined to do nothing the papers a history of united states involvement in vietnam mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations he was persuaded by kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared and the president tried to prevent publication the supreme court eventually ruled for the newspapers as us troop withdrawals continued conscription was reduced and in ended the armed forces became allvolunteer after years of fighting the paris peace accords were signed at the beginning of the agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining american troops however it did not require the north vietnam army regulars located in the south to withdraw once american combat support ended there was a brief truce before fighting broke out again this time without american combat involvement north vietnam conquered south vietnam in  nixon had been a firm supporter of kennedy in the bay of pigs invasion and cuban missile crisis on taking office he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president fidel castro he maintained close relations with the cubanamerican exile community through his friend bebe rebozo who often suggested ways of irritating castro these activities concerned the soviets and cubans who feared nixon might attack cuba and break the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis in august the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the understanding despite his hard line against castro nixon agreed the process had not yet been completed when the soviets began expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october a minor confrontation ensued which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles the final round of diplomatic notes reaffirming the accord were exchanged in november the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september spurred nixon and kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to allende first designed to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup other support included strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents it was even alleged that nixon personally authorized in covert funds to print antiallende messages in a prominent chilean newspaper following an extended period of social political and economic unrest general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup dtat on september among the dead was allende nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace following the announcement of his visit to china the nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the soviet union the president and first lady arrived in moscow on may and met with leonid brezhnev the general secretary of the communist party alexei kosygin the chairman of the council of ministers and nikolai podgorny the head of state among other leading soviet officials nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties salt i the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers and the antiballistic missile treaty which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of peaceful coexistence a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin seeking to foster better relations with the united states both china and the soviet union cut back on their diplomatic support for north vietnam and advised hanoi to come to terms militarily nixon later described his strategy i had long believed that an indispensable element of any successful peace initiative in vietnam was to enlist if possible the help of the soviets and the chinese though rapprochement with china and dtente with the soviet union were ends in themselves i also considered them possible means to hasten the end of the war at worst hanoi was bound to feel less confident if washington was dealing with moscow and beijing at best if the two major communist powers decided that they had bigger fish to fry hanoi would be pressured into negotiating a settlement we could accept having made considerable progress over the previous two years in ussoviet relations nixon embarked on a second trip to the soviet union in he arrived in moscow on june to a welcome ceremony cheering crowds and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening nixon and brezhnev met in yalta where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact dtente and mirvs while he considered proposing a comprehensive testban treaty nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it there were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations as part of the nixon doctrine that the us would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible instead giving them assistance to defend themselves the us greatly increased arms sales to the middle eastparticularly israel iran and saudi arabiaduring the nixon administration the nixon administration strongly supported israel an american ally in the middle east but the support was not unconditional nixon believed that israel should make peace with its arab neighbors and that the united states should encourage it the president believed thatexcept during the suez crisisthe us had failed to intervene with israel and should use the leverage of the large us military aid to israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table however the arabisraeli conflict was not a major focus of nixons attention during his first termfor one thing he felt that no matter what he did american jews would oppose his reelectiona on october an arab coalition led by egypt and syria supported with tons of arms and materiel by the soviet union attacked israel in what was known as the yom kippur war israel suffered heavy losses and nixon ordered an airlift to resupply israeli losses cutting through interdepartmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by arab nations more than a week later by the time the us and soviet union began negotiating a truce israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory the truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis when israel gained the upperhand egyptian president sadat requested a joint usussr peacekeeping mission which the us refused when soviet premier brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily nixon ordered the us military to defcon placing all us military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war this was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the cuban missile crisis brezhnev backed down as a result of nixons actions because israels victory was largely due to us support the arab opec nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the us resulting in the oil crisis the embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the united states in late and was eventually ended by the oilproducing nations as peace in the middle east took hold after the war and under nixons presidency the us reestablished relations with egypt for the first time since nixon used the middle east crisis to restart the stalled middle east peace negotiations he wrote in a confidential memo to kissinger on october  i believe that beyond a doubt we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in years to build a lasting peace in the middle east i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by i now consider a permanent middle east settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the middle east in june and became the first president to visit israel at the time nixon took office in inflation was at percentits highest rate since the korean war the great society had been enacted under johnson which together with the vietnam war costs was causing large budget deficits unemployment was low but interest rates were at their highest in a century nixons major economic goal was to reduce inflation the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war this could not be accomplished overnight and the us economy continued to struggle through contributing to a lackluster republican performance in the midterm congressional elections democrats controlled both houses of congress throughout nixons presidency according to political economist nigel bowles in his study of nixons economic record the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection as part of his new federalism views he proposed grants to the states but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process however nixon gained political credit for advocating them in congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes though the democratic majorities knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career did not expect nixon to actually use the authority with inflation unresolved by august and an election year looming nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david he then announced temporary wage and price controls allowed the dollar to float against other currencies and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold bowles points out by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents to criticize him his opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself nixons policies dampened inflation through although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration after he won reelection nixon found inflation returning he reimposed price controls in june the price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy the controls produced food shortages as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss despite the failure to control inflation controls were slowly ended and on april their statutory authorization lapsed nixon advocated a new federalism which would devolve power to state and local elected officials though congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them he eliminated the cabinetlevel united states post office department which in became the governmentrun united states postal service nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the election the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject he saw that the first earth day in april presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject and sought to use that to his benefit in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency epa nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his state of the union speech other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of and occupational safety and health administration osha the national environmental policy act required environmental impact statements for many federal projects nixon vetoed the clean water act of objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them which he deemed excessive after congress overrode his veto nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable in nixon proposed health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandateb federalization of medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children and support for health maintenance organizations hmos a limited hmo bill was enacted in in nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reforma private health insurance employer mandateb and replacement of medicaid by staterun health insurance plans available to all with incomebased premiums and cost sharing concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among american soldiers in vietnam nixon called for a war on drugs pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities as one policy initiative nixon called for more money for sicklecell research treatment and education in february and signed the national sickle cell anemia control act on may c while nixon called for increased spending on such highprofile items as sicklecell disease and for a war on cancer at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the national institutes of health the nixon presidency witnessed the first largescale integration of public schools in the south nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites hopeful of doing well in the south in he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then soon after his inauguration he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force which worked with local leadersboth white and blackto determine how to integrate local schools agnew had little interest in the work and most of it was done by labor secretary george shultz federal aid was available and a meeting with president nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees by september less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools by however tensions over desegregation surfaced in northern cities with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use in addition to desegregating public schools nixon implemented the philadelphia plan in the first significant federal affirmative action program he also endorsed the equal rights amendment after it passed both houses of congress in and went to the states for ratification nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election nevertheless he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had after a nearly decadelong national effort the united states won the race to land astronauts on the moon on july with the flight of apollo nixon spoke with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin during their moonwalk he called the conversation the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon however was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the high level seen through the s as nasa prepared to send men to the moon nasa administrator thomas o paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the moon by the end of the s and the launch of a manned expedition to mars as early as nixon however rejected both proposals due to the expense nixon also canceled the air force manned orbital laboratory program in because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more costeffective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective on march nixon announced the end of the kennedyjohnson eras massive efforts in the space race stating we must think of space activities as part of a continuing process and not as a series of separate leaps each requiring a massive concentration of energy space expenditures must take their proper place within a rigorous system of national priorities what we do in space from here on in must become a normal and regular part of our national life and must therefore be planned in conjunction with all of the other undertakings which are important to us he then cancelled the last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the space shuttle on may nixon approved a fiveyear cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program culminating in the joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment the democratic solid south had long been a source of frustration to republican ambitions goldwater had won several southern states by opposing the civil rights act of but had alienated more moderate southerners nixons efforts to gain southern support in were diluted by wallaces candidacy through his first term he pursued a southern strategy with policies such as his desegregation plans that would be broadly acceptable among southern whites encouraging them to realign with the republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights era he nominated two southern conservatives clement haynsworth and g harrold carswell to the supreme court but neither was confirmed by the senate nixon entered his name on the new hampshire primary ballot on january effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection virtually assured the republican nomination the president had initially expected his democratic opponent to be massachusetts senator ted kennedy brother of the late president but he was largely removed from contention after the chappaquiddick incident instead maine senator edmund muskie became the front runner with south dakota senator george mcgovern in a close second place on june mcgovern won the california primary and secured the democratic nomination the following month nixon was renominated at the republican national convention he dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization mcgovern was perceived as standing for amnesty abortion and acid mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate missouri senator thomas eagleton dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle and was reelected on november in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history he defeated mcgovern with over percent of the popular vote losing only in massachusetts and the district of columbia the term watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the nixon administration those activities included dirty tricks or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures the activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into democratic party headquarters at the watergate complex in washington dc on june the washington post picked up on the story reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relied on an informant known as deep throatlater revealed to be mark felt associate director at the fbito link the men to the nixon administration nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics calling news articles biased and misleading a series of revelations made it clear that the committee to reelect president nixon and later the white house was involved in attempts to sabotage the democrats senior aides such as white house counsel john dean faced prosecution in total officials were convicted of wrongdoing in july white house aide alexander butterfield testified under oath to congress that nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the oval office these tapes were subpoenaed by watergate special counsel archibald cox nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes citing executive privilege with the white house and cox at loggerheads nixon had cox fired in october in the saturday night massacre he was replaced by leon jaworski in november nixons lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the white house on june featured an minute gap rose mary woods the presidents personal secretary claimed responsibility for the gap alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape though her tale was widely mocked the gap while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the president cast doubt on nixons statement that he had been unaware of the coverup though nixon lost much popular support even from his own party he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office he insisted that he had made mistakes but had no prior knowledge of the burglary did not break any laws and did not learn of the coverup until early on october vice president agnew resigned unrelated to watergate and was convicted on charges of bribery tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as governor of maryland nixon chose gerald ford minority leader of the house of representatives to replace agnew on november during a televised question and answer session with the press nixon said people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook well im not a crook ive earned everything ive got the legal battle over the tapes continued through early and in april nixon announced the release of pages of transcripts of white house conversations between him and his aides the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may which were televised on the major tv networks these hearings culminated in votes for impeachment on july the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes not just selected transcripts must be released the scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the president ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due and paid in back taxes in  even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations nixon hoped to fight the charges however one of the new tapes recorded soon after the breakin demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place and had approved plans to thwart the investigation in a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the smoking gun tape on august nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of white house involvement stating that he had a lapse of memory he met with republican congressional leaders soon after and was told he faced certain impeachment in the house and had at most only votes in his favor in the senate far fewer than the he needed to avoid removal from office in light of his loss of political support and the nearcertainty of impeachment nixon resigned the office of the presidency on august after addressing the nation on television the previous evening the resignation speech was delivered from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president gerald ford nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency especially in foreign policy he defended his record as president quoting from theodore roosevelts speech citizenship in a republic sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deed who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly nixons speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had not admitted wrongdoing it was termed a masterpiece by conrad black one of his biographers black opined that what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office following his resignation the nixons flew to their home la casa pacifica in san clemente california according to his biographer aitken after his resignation nixon was a soul in torment congress had funded nixons transition costs including some salary expenses though reducing the appropriation from to with some of his staff still with him nixon was at his desk by amwith little to do his former press secretary ron ziegler sat with him alone for hours each day nixons resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished the ford white house considered a pardon of nixon though it would be unpopular in the country nixon contacted by ford emissaries was initially reluctant to accept the pardon but then agreed to do so ford however insisted on a statement of contrition nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document ford eventually agreed and on september he granted nixon a full free and absolute pardon which ended any possibility of an indictment nixon then released a statement i was wrong in not acting more decisively and more forthrightly in dealing with watergate particularly when it reached the stage of judicial proceedings and grew from a political scandal into a national tragedy no words can describe the depth of my regret and pain at the anguish my mistakes over watergate have caused the nation and the presidency a nation i so deeply love and an institution i so greatly respect in october nixon fell ill with phlebitis told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die a reluctant nixon chose surgery and president ford visited him in the hospital nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aidesdean haldeman and john ehrlichmanand the washington post disbelieving his illness printed a cartoon showing nixon with a cast on the wrong foot judge john sirica excused nixons presence despite the defendants objections congress instructed ford to retain nixons presidential papersbeginning a threedecade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate nixon was in the hospital when the midterm elections were held and watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the republican loss of seats in the house and three in the senate in december nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable illwill against him in the country he wrote in his diary referring to himself and pat so be it we will see it through weve had tough times before and we can take the tougher ones that we will have to go through now that is perhaps what we were made forto be able to take punishment beyond what anyone in this office has had before particularly after leaving office this is a test of character and we must not fail the test by early nixons health was improving he maintained an office in a coast guard station yards from his home at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day he mainly worked on his memoirs he had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly he was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in february which compelled him to part with many of his staff including ziegler in august of that year he met with british talkshow host and producer david frost who paid him for a series of sitdown interviews filmed and aired in they began on the topic of foreign policy recounting the leaders he had known but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on watergate nixon admitted that he had let down the country and that i brought myself down i gave them a sword and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish and i guess if id been in their position id have done the same thing the interviews garnered million viewersbecoming the mostwatched program of their kind in television history the interviews helped improve nixons financial positionat one point in early he had only in the bankas did the sale of his key biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy nixon friends such as bebe rebozo in february nixon visited china at the personal invitation of mao nixon had wanted to return to china but chose to wait until after fords own visit in nixon remained neutral in the close primary battle between ford and reagan ford won but was defeated by georgia governor jimmy carter in the general election the carter administration had little use for nixon and blocked his planned trip to australia causing the government of prime minister malcolm fraser to withhold its official invitation in nixon was disbarred in the state of new york for obstruction of justice in the watergate affair nixon chose not to present any defense in early nixon went to the united kingdom he was shunned by american diplomats and by most ministers of the james callaghan government he was welcomed however by the leader of the opposition margaret thatcher as well as by former prime ministers lord home and sir harold wilson two other former prime ministers harold macmillan and edward heath declined to meet him nixon addressed the oxford union regarding watergate some people say i didnt handle it properly and theyre right i screwed it up mea culpa but lets get on to my achievements youll be here in the year and well see how im regarded then in nixon published his memoirs rn the memoirs of richard nixon the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement the book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response nixon journeyed to the white house in invited by carter for the state dinner for chinese vice premier deng

containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of mikhail gorbachev following this trip nixon was ranked in a gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world in nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers impressing his audience with his tour dhorizon of the world at the time political pundit elizabeth drew wrote even when he was wrong nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times newsweek ran a story on nixons comeback with the headline hes back on july the richard nixon library and birthplace in yorba linda california opened as a private institution with the nixons in attendance they were joined by a large crowd of people including presidents ford reagan and george h w bush as well as their wives betty nancy and barbara in january the former president founded the nixon center today the

julie and four grandchildren in keeping with his wishes his funeral was not a full state funeral though his body did lie in repose in the nixon library lobby from april to the morning of the funeral service mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly wet weather to pay their respects at its peak the line to pass by nixons casket was three miles long with an estimated people waiting to pay their respects john f stacks of time magazine said of nixon shortly after his death an outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every selfcreated disaster that he faced to reclaim a respected place in american public life after his resignation he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the worlds leaders and by the time bill clinton came to the white house in nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman clinton whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach nixon met openly with him and regularly sought his advice tom wicker of the new york times noted that nixon had been equalled only by franklin roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and quoting nixons farewell speech wrote richard nixons jowly beardshadowed face the skijump nose and the widows peak the arms upstretched in the vsign had been so often pictured and caricatured his presence had become such a familiar one in the land he had been so often in the heat of controversy that it was hard to realize the nation really would not have nixon to kick around anymore ambrose said of the reaction to nixons death to everyones amazement except his hes our beloved elder statesman upon nixons death almost all of the news coverage mentioned watergate but for the most part the coverage was favorable to the former president the dallas morning news stated history ultimately should show that despite his flaws he was one of our most farsighted chief executives this offended some columnist russell baker complained of a group conspiracy to grant him absolution cartoonist jeff koterba of the omaha worldherald depicted history before a blank canvas his subject nixon as america looks on eagerly the artist urges his audience to sit down the work will take some time to complete as this portrait is a little more complicated than most historian and political scientist james macgregor burns observed of nixon how can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president so brilliant and so morally lacking nixons biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history according to ambrose nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished what he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation irwin gellman who chronicled nixons congressional career suggests that he was remarkable among his congressional peers a success story in a troubled era one who steered a sensible anticommunist course against the excess of mccarthy aitken feels that nixon both as a man and as a statesman has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism no simple verdict is possible nixons southern strategy is credited by some historians as causing the south to become a republican stronghold though others deem economic factors more important to the change throughout his career he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing soviet communism according to his biographer herbert parmet nixons role was to steer the republican party along a middle course somewhere between the competitive impulses of the rockefellers the goldwaters and the reagans nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation historian paul charles milazzo in his paper on nixon and the environment points to nixons creation of the epa and his enforcement of legislation such as the endangered species act stating that though unsought and unacknowledged richard nixons environmental legacy is secure nixon saw his policies regarding vietnam china and the soviets as key to his place in history george mcgovern nixons onetime opponent commented in president nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers china and the soviet union than any other president since world war ii with the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in vietnam nixon really will get high marks in history political scientist jussi m hanhimki disagrees saying nixons diplomacy was merely a continuation of the cold war policy of containment using diplomatic rather than military means historian christopher andrew concludes that nixon was a great statesman on the world stage as well as a shabby practitioner of electoral politics in the domestic arena while the criminal farce of watergate was in the making nixons inspirational statesmanship was establishing new working relationships with both communist china and the soviet union historian keith w olson has written that nixon left a negative legacy fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in vietnam and watergate during the impeachment of bill clinton in both sides tried to use nixon and watergate to their advantage republicans suggested that clintons misconduct had been comparable to nixons while democrats contended that nixons actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent another legacy for a time was a decrease in the power of the presidency as congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of watergate olson suggests that grants of power to george w bush in the aftermath of the attacks restored the presidents power nixons career was frequently dogged by his persona and the publics perception of it editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred he was often portrayed with unshaven jowls slumped shoulders and a furrowed sweaty brow nixon had a complex personality both very secretive and awkward yet strikingly reflective about himself he was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects wearing a coat and tie even when home alone nixon biographer conrad black described him as being driven though also uneasy with himself in some ways according to black nixon thought that he was doomed to be traduced doublecrossed unjustly harassed misunderstood underappreciated and subjected to the trials of job but that by the application of his mighty will tenacity and diligence he would ultimately prevail biographer elizabeth drew summarized nixon as a smart talented man but most peculiar and haunted of presidents in his account of the nixon presidency author richard reeves described nixon as a strange man of uncomfortable shyness who functioned best alone with his thoughts nixons presidency was doomed by his personality reeves argues he assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them he clung to the idea of being tough he thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness but that was what betrayed him he could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president even bebe rebozo by some accounts his closest friend did not call him by his first name nixon stated of this even with close friends i dont believe in letting your hair down confiding this and that and the other thingsaying gee i couldnt sleep i believe you should keep your troubles to yourself thats just the way i am some people are different some people think its good therapy to sit with a close friend and you know just spill your guts and reveal their inner psychewhether they were breastfed or bottlefed not me no way when told that most americans even at the end of his career did not feel they knew him nixon replied yeah its true and its not necessary for them to know

democratic strategist reflected on santorums campaign and his connection to the unpopular president in we were doubly blessedwe could run against george w bush and rick santorum santorum chose to campaign alongside george w bush and called him a terrific president hurting his popularity also problematic was santorums endorsement of his republican senate colleague arlen specter over conservative congressman pat toomey in the primary for pennsylvanias other senate seat many socially and fiscally conservative republicans considered the specter endorsement to be a betrayal of their cause santorums opponent was democratic state treasurer bob casey jr the son of popular former governor robert casey sr casey was well known for his opposition to abortion negating one of santorums key issues for most of the campaign santorum trailed casey by points or more in polls green party candidate carl romanelli failed to gain ballot access in the race further hurting santorums chances

adviser to santorums senate and presidential races reflected back on the books controversies and said santorum was warned that sections could bring political damage and santorum was not willing to

center of the storm his remarks were heavily criticized especially in massachusetts and he was asked for an explanation santorum did not retract his statement and defended his premise that it was no surprise that the center of the catholic church abuse took place in very liberal or perhaps the nations most liberal area boston in addition the question of santorums association with the k street project was an issue that his opponent made use of during the campaign santorum stated that he spent maybe a month a year at his pennsylvania home raising allegations of hypocrisy as he had denounced his former opponent doug walgren for living away from his house district critics also complained that pennsylvania taxpayers were paying of the tuition for five of santorums children to attend an online cyber schoola benefit available only to pennsylvania residentswhen all his children lived in virginia the penn hills school district which covered the tuition costs for the cyber school through local taxes unsuccessfully filed a complaint against santorum for reimbursement in but won reimbursement from the state in september in the amount of in response santorum asked county officials to remove the homestead tax exemption from his penn hills property saying he was entitled to it but chose not to take it because of the political dispute since santorum has been homeschooling his seven children santorum responded to the dispute saying that his children should not be implicated in the politics of personal destruction one of his children appeared in a reelection campaign ad saying my dads opponents have criticized him for moving us to washington so we could be with him more santorum ran a television ad suggesting that caseys supporters had been under investigation for various crimes the negative ad backfired as the the scranton timestribune found that all but a few of caseys contributors donated when he was running for other offices and none were investigated for anything

donated to educational institutions toward the end of his campaign santorum shifted his theme to the threat of radical islam in october he gave a gathering storm speech invoking british prime minister

such as the american veterans committee he fought against republicansponsored righttowork legislation and for helen gahagan douglas in when she was defeated for the senate by richard nixon it was his

december he was stopped from leading an antinuclear rally in hollywood by pressure from the warner bros studio he would later make nuclear weapons a key point of his presidency specifically his

were free he also joined the national rifle association and would become a lifetime member reagan gained national attention in his speeches for conservative presidential contender barry goldwater in speaking for goldwater reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government consolidating themes he had developed in talks for ge he argued in a time for choosing october  the founding fathers knew a government cant control the economy without controlling people and they knew when a government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose so we have come to a time for choosing you and i are told we must choose between a left or right but i suggest there is no such thing as a left or right there is only an up or down up to mans ageold dream the maximum of individual freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism this a time for choosing speech was not enough to turn around the faltering goldwater campaign but it was the key event that established reagans national political visibility california republicans were impressed with reagans political views and charisma after his time for choosing speech he announced in late his campaign for governor of california in he defeated former san francisco mayor george christopher in the gop primary in reagans campaign he emphasized two main themes to send the welfare bums back to work and in reference to burgeoning antiwar and antiestablishment student protests at the university of california at berkeley to clean up the mess at berkeley ronald reagan accomplished in what us

government hiring and approved tax hikes to balance the budget shortly after the beginning of his term reagan tested the presidential waters in as part of a stop nixon movement hoping to cut into nixons southern support and be a compromise candidate if neither nixon nor secondplace nelson rockefeller received enough delegates to win on the first ballot at the republican convention however by the time of the convention nixon had delegate votes more than he needed to secure the nomination followed by rockefeller with reagan in third place reagan was involved in highprofile conflicts with the protest movements of the era on may during the peoples park protests at uc berkeley reagan sent the california highway patrol and other officers to quell the protests in an incident that became known as bloody thursday resulting in the death of student james rector and the blinding of carpenter alan blanchard reagan then called out state national guard troops to occupy the city of berkeley for two weeks to crack down on the protesters a year after bloody thursday reagan responded to questions about campus protest movements saying if it takes a bloodbath lets get it over with no more appeasement when the symbionese liberation army kidnapped patty hearst in berkeley and demanded the distribution of food to the poor reagan joked to a group of political aides about a botulism outbreak contaminating the food conversely in that one afternoon bloody thursday police officers were injured including one chp officer who was knifed in the chest after calling in the national guard the guard remained in berkeley for days camping in peoples park and demonstrations subsided as the university removed cordonedoff fencing and placed all development plans for peoples park on hold early in the national debate on abortion was beginning democratic california state senator anthony c beilenson introduced the therapeutic abortion act in an effort to reduce the number of backroom abortions performed in california the state legislature sent the bill to reagans desk where after many days of indecision he signed it about two million abortions would be performed as a result most because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the wellbeing of the mother reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor he would not have signed it after he recognized what he called the consequences of the bill he announced that he was prolife he maintained that position later in his political career writing extensively about abortion in reagan signed the mulford act which became california penal code and c the bill repealed a law allowing public carrying of loaded firearms named after republican assemblyman don mulford the bill garnered national attention after the black panthers marched bearing arms upon the california state capitol to protest the bill despite an unsuccessful attempt to recall him in reagan was reelected in defeating big daddy jesse m unruh he chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle one of reagans greatest frustrations in office concerned capital punishment which he strongly supported his efforts to enforce the states laws in this area were thwarted when the supreme court of california issued its people v anderson decision which invalidated all death sentences issued in california before though the decision was later overturned by a constitutional amendment the only execution during reagans governorship was on april when aaron mitchells sentence was carried out by the state in san quentins gas chamber in reagan as governor signed the family law act an amalgam of two bills which had been written and revised by the california state legislature for over two years and became the first nofault divorce legislation in the united states reagans terms as governor helped to shape the policies he would pursue in his later political career as president by campaigning on a platform of sending the welfare bums back to work he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state he also strongly advocated the republican ideal of less government regulation of the economy including that of undue federal taxation reagan did not seek reelection to a third term as governor in and was succeeded by democratic california secretary of state jerry brown on january  in reagan challenged incumbent president gerald ford in a bid to become the republican partys candidate for president reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of likeminded organizations such as the american conservative union which became key components of his political base while president ford was considered a more moderate republican reagans campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager john sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of fords likely nomination reagan won north carolina texas and california but the strategy failed as he ended up losing new hampshire florida and his native illinois the texas campaign lent renewed hope to reagan when he swept all ninetysix delegates chosen in the may primary with four more awaiting at the state convention much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three cochairmen including ernest angelo the mayor of midland and ray barnhart of houston whom president reagan would appoint in as director of the federal highway administration however as the gop convention neared ford appeared close to victory acknowledging his partys moderate wing reagan chose moderate senator richard schweiker of pennsylvania as his running mate if nominated nonetheless ford prevailed with delegates to reagans ford would go on to lose the presidential election to the democrat jimmy carter reagans concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the soviet union though he lost the nomination he received writein votes in new hampshire votes as an independent on wyomings ballot and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the november election from the state of washington which ford had won over democratic challenger jimmy carter after the campaign reagan remained in the public debate with the ronald reagan radio commentary series and his political action committee citizens for the republic which was later revived in alexandria virginia in by the reagan biographer craig shirley the presidential campaign between reagan and incumbent president jimmy carter was conducted during domestic concerns and the ongoing iran hostage crisis his campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles lower taxes to stimulate the economy less government interference in peoples lives states rights and a strong national defense reagan launched his campaign by declaring i believe in states rights after receiving the republican nomination reagan selected one of his primary opponents george h w bush to be his running mate his showing in the october televised debate boosted his campaign reagan won the election carrying states with electoral votes to electoral votes for carter representing six states and washington dc reagan received of the popular vote while carter took and independent john b anderson a liberal republican received republicans captured the senate for the first time since and gained house seats but the democrats retained a majority during his presidency reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom brought changes domestically both to the us economy and expanded military and contributed to the end of the cold war termed the reagan revolution his presidency would reinvigorate american morale reinvigorate the american economy and reduce american reliance upon government as president reagan kept a diary in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day the diaries were published in may in the bestselling book the reagan diaries to date reagan is the oldest person elected to the office of the presidency at and the oldest president at the time of inauguration at years days in his first inaugural address on january which reagan himself wrote he addressed the countrys economic malaise arguing in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problems government is the problem in reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer the school prayer had previously been banned by the supreme court in and reagans election reflected an opposition to the courts decision reagans proposed amendment stated nothing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions no person shall be required by the united states or by any state to participate in prayer in a message to congress reagan said that his proposed amendment would restore the simple freedom of our citizens to offer prayer in public schools and institutions in a nationally televised speech the following day rabbi menachem mendel schneerson lauded reagans speech and said the moment of silence would ensure that children grow up to be decent and upright in reagan again raised the issue asking congress why cant the freedom to acknowledge god be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land in reagan expressed his disappointment that the supreme court ruling still bans a moment of silence for publicschool and said he had an uphill battle in reagan again renewed his call for congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end the expulsion of god from americas classrooms during his term in office reagan campaigned vigorously to restore prayer to the schools first as a moment of prayer and later as a moment of silence on march only days into the new administration reagan his press secretary james brady washington police officer thomas delahanty and secret service agent tim mccarthy were struck by gunfire from wouldbe assassin john hinckley jr outside the washington hilton hotel although close to death upon arrival at george washington university hospital reagan was stabilized in the emergency room then underwent emergency exploratory surgery he recovered and was released from the hospital on april becoming the first serving us president to survive being shot in an assassination attempt the attempt had great influence on reagans popularity polls indicated his approval rating to be around reagan believed that god had spared his life so that he might go on to fulfill a greater purpose in response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners reagan in nominated ernest w lefever as assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the senate committee rejected his nomination by vote of lefever withdrew his name in summer patco the union of federal air traffic controllers went on strike violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking declaring the situation an emergency as described in the tafthartley act reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers do not report for work within hours they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated they did not return and on august reagan fired striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nations commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained a leading reference work on public administration concluded the firing of patco employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared during jimmy carters last year in office inflation

and real gdp growth averaged with a high of in while nominal gdp growth averaged and peaked at in  reagan implemented policies based on supplyside economics advocating a laissezfaire philosophy and freemarket fiscal policy seeking to stimulate the economy with large acrosstheboard tax cuts he also supported returning the united states to some sort of gold standard and successfully urged congress to establish the us gold commission to study how one could be implemented citing the economic theories of arthur laffer reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation a theory that entered political discussion as the laffer curve reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt his policy of peace through strength resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a real increase in defense spending between and  during reagans presidency federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from to and the lowest bracket from to however other tax increases passed by congress and signed by reagan ensured that tax revenues over his two terms were of gdp as compared to over the year period then in the job training partnership act of was signed into law initiating one of the united states first publicprivate partnerships and a major part of the presidents job creation program reagans assistant secretary of labor and chief of staff al angrisani was a primary architect of the bill conversely congress passed and reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from to to continue funding such government programs as tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of tefra social security and the deficit reduction act of defra despite the fact that tefra was the largest peacetime tax increase in american history gross domestic product gdp growth recovered strongly after the early s recession ended in and grew during his eight years in office at an annual rate of per year with a high of growth in unemployment peaked at monthly rate in december higher than any time since the great depressionthen dropped during the rest of reagans presidency sixteen million new jobs were created while inflation significantly decreased the tax reform act of another bipartisan effort championed by reagan simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks the top rate was dropped to but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from to the increase of the lowest tax bracket from to was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption standard deduction and earned income tax credit the net result was the removal of six million poor americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels the net effect of all reaganera tax bills was a decrease in government revenues when compared to treasury department revenue estimates from the administrations first postenactment january budgets however federal income tax receipts increased from to rising from billion to billion or an average annual rate of attributed to higher social security receipts and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of  reagans policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment which would then lead to higher employment and wages critics labeled this trickledown economicsthe belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a trickledown effect to the poor questions arose whether reagans policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty and many poor and minority citizens viewed reagan as indifferent to their struggles these views were exacerbated by the fact that reagans economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at an hour slashing federal assistance to local governments by cutting the budget for public housing and section rent subsidies in half and eliminating the antipoverty community development block grant program the widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the s before reagans economic policies took effect along with reagans cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages with both topping out at reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency all in the name of fiscal responsibility according to paul krugman over all the tax increase undid about a third of the cut as a share of gdp the increase was substantially larger than mrclintons tax increase according to historian and domestic policy adviser bruce bartlett reagans tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the tax cut further following his opposition to government intervention reagan cut the budgets of nonmilitary programs including medicaid food stamps federal education programs and the epa while he protected entitlement programs such as social security and medicare his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the social security disability rolls the administrations stance toward the savings and loan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis it is also suggested by a minority of reaganomics critics that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash in order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits the united states borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad raising the national debt from billion to trillion reagan described the new debt as the greatest disappointment of his presidency he reappointed paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve and in he appointed monetarist alan greenspan to succeed him reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil which had contributed to energy crises in the early s the price of oil subsequently dropped and the s did not see the fuel shortages that the s had reagan also fulfilled a campaign promise to repeal the windfall profit tax in which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil some economists such as nobel prize winners milton friedman and robert mundell argue that reagans tax policies invigorated americas economy and contributed to the economic boom of the s other economists such as nobel prize winner robert solow argue that reagans deficits were a major reason his successor george hw bush reneged on a campaign promise and resorted to raising taxes during reagans presidency a program was initiated within the us intelligence community to ensure americas economic strength the program project socrates developed and demonstrated the means required for the united states to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantageautomated innovation to ensure that the united states acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation reagan during his second term had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the project socrates results on a nationwide basis however reagans term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed and the incoming bush administration labeling project socrates as industrial policy had it terminated reagan escalated the cold war accelerating a reversal from the policy of dtente which began in after the soviet war in afghanistan reagan ordered a massive buildup of the united states armed forces and implemented new policies towards the soviet union reviving the b lancer program that had been canceled by the carter administration and producing the mx missile in response to soviet deployment of the ss reagan oversaw natos deployment of the pershing missile in west germany in journalist nicholas lemann interviewed reagan secretary of defense caspar weinberger and summarized the strategy of the reagan administration to roll back the soviet union their society is economically weak and it lacks the wealth education and technology to enter the information age they have thrown everything into military production and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result they cant sustain military production the way we can eventually it will break them and then there will be just one superpower in a safe world if only if we can keep spending lemann notes that when he wrote that in he thought the reaganites were living in a fantasy world but in he says that passage represents a fairly uncontroversial description of what reagan actually did together with the united kingdoms prime minister margaret thatcher reagan denounced the soviet union in ideological terms in a famous address on june to the british parliament in the royal gallery of the palace of westminster reagan said the forward march of freedom and democracy will leave marxismleninism on the ash heap of history on march he predicted that communism would collapse stating communism is another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written in a speech to the national association of evangelicals on march reagan called the soviet union an evil empire after soviet fighters downed korean air lines flight near moneron island on september carrying people including georgia congressman larry mcdonald reagan labeled the act a massacre and declared that the soviets had turned against the world and the moral precepts which guide human relations among people everywhere the reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all soviet passenger air service to the united states and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the soviets wounding them financially as result of the shootdown and the cause of kal s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system reagan announced on september that the global positioning system would be made available for civilian use free of charge once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in future under a policy that came to be known as the reagan doctrine reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anticommunist resistance movements in an effort to rollback sovietbacked communist governments in africa asia and latin america reagan deployed the cias special activities division to afghanistan and pakistan they were instrumental in training equipping and leading mujaheddin forces against the soviet army president reagans covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan though some of the united states funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to us troops in the s decade war in afghanistan however in a break from the carter policy of arming taiwan under the taiwan relations act reagan also agreed with the communist government in china to reduce the sale of arms to taiwan in march reagan introduced the strategic defense initiative a defense project that would have used ground and spacebased systems to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible there was much disbelief surrounding the programs scientific feasibility leading opponents to dub sdi star wars and argue that its technological objective was unattainable the soviets became concerned about the possible effects sdi would have leader yuri andropov said it would put the entire world in jeopardy for those reasons david gergen former aide to president reagan believes that in retrospect sdi hastened the end of the cold war critics labeled reagans foreign policies as aggressive imperialistic and chided them as warmongering though they were supported by leading american conservatives who argued that they were necessary to protect us security interests the reagan administration also backed anticommunist leaders accused of severe human rights violations such as efran ros montt of guatemala and hissne habr of chad with the approval of congress reagan in sent forces to lebanon to reduce the threat of the lebanese civil war the american peacekeeping forces in beirut a part of a multinational force during the lebanese civil war were attacked on october the beirut barracks bombing killed american servicemen and wounded more than others by a suicide truck bomber reagan sent in the uss new jersey battleship to shell syrian positions in lebanon he then withdrew all the marines from lebanon on october reagan ordered us forces to invade grenada code named operation urgent fury where a coup dtat had established an independent nonaligned marxistleninist government a formal appeal from the organisation of eastern caribbean states oecs led to the intervention of us forces president reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a sovietcuban military buildup in the caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred american medical students at stgeorges university as adequate reasons to invade operation urgent fury was the first major military operation conducted by us forces since the vietnam war several days of fighting commenced resulting in a us victory with american fatalities and wounded american soldiers in middecember after a new government was appointed by the governorgeneral us forces withdrew reagan accepted the republican nomination in dallas texas he proclaimed that it was morning again in america regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the us athletes at the summer olympics among other things he became the first american president to open an olympic games held in the united states reagans opponent in the presidential election was former vice president walter mondale with questions about reagans age and a weak performance in the first presidential debate his ability to perform the duties of president for another term was questioned his apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters they had previously known him clever and witty rumors began to circulate that he had alzheimers disease reagan rebounded in the second debate and confronted questions about his age quipping i will not make age an issue of this campaign i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience which generated applause and laughter even from mondale himself that november reagan was reelected winning of states the presidents overwhelming victory saw mondale carry only his home state of minnesota by votes and the district of columbia reagan won a record electoral votes the most of any candidate in united states history and received of the popular vote to mondales  reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on january in a private ceremony at the white house because january fell on a sunday a public celebration was not held but took place in the capitol rotunda the following day january was one of the coldest days on record in washington dc due to poor weather inaugural celebrations were held inside the capitol in the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat moving white house chief of staff james baker to secretary of the treasury and naming treasury secretary donald regan a former merrill lynch officer chief of staff in reagan visited a german military cemetery in bitburg to lay a wreath with west german chancellor helmut kohl it was determined that the cemetery held the graves of fortynine members of the waffenss reagan issued a statement that called the nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves victims a designation which ignited a stir over whether reagan had equated the ss men to victims of the holocaust pat buchanan reagans director of communications argued that the president did not equate the ss members with the actual holocaust now strongly urged to cancel the visit the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to chancellor kohl he ultimately attended the ceremony where two military generals laid a wreath the disintegration of the space shuttle challenger on january proved a pivotal moment in reagans presidency all seven astronauts aboard were killed on the night of the disaster reagan delivered a speech written by peggy noonan in which he said the future doesnt belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god in near the end of the iraniraq war the us navy guided missile cruiser uss vincennes accidentally shot down iran air flight killing civilian passengers the incident further worsened already tense iranunited states relations reagan announced a war on drugs in in response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic though nixon had previously declared a war on drugs reagan advocated more militant policies he said that drugs were menacing our society and promised to fight for drugfree schools and workplaces expanded drug treatment stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts and greater public awareness in reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted billion to fund the war on drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses the bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street while resulting in a great financial burden for america defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use first lady nancy reagan made the war on drugs her main priority by founding the just say no drug awareness campaign which aimed to discourage children and teenagers from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying no nancy reagan traveled to cities in states raising awareness about the dangers of drugs including alcohol the reagan administration largely ignored the aids crisis which began to unfold in the united states in the same year reagan took office aids research was chronically underfunded during reagans administration and requests for more funding by doctors at the centers for disease control cdc were routinely denied by the end of the first months of the epidemic when more than people had died of aids in the us the cdc had spent less than million on aids research in contrast funding had been made amply available to the cdc in their efforts to stop legionnaires disease after an outbreak in the cdc had spent million in fighting legionnaires disease though the outbreak had caused fewer than deaths by the time president reagan had given his first speech on the epidemic some six years into his presidency americans had been diagnosed with aids and had died of it by the end of the year reagan left office people had been diagnosed with aids in the united states and more than of them had died of it it has been suggested that far fewer would have died both then and in the decades that followed if the reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting aids as gerald fords administration had applied to fighting legionnaires disease relations between libya and the united states under president reagan were continually contentious beginning with the gulf of sidra incident in by libyan leader muammar gaddafi was considered by the cia to be along with ussr leader leonid brezhnev and cuban leader fidel castro part of a group known as the unholy trinity and was also labeled as our international public enemy number one by a cia official these tensions were later revived in early april when a bomb exploded in a berlin discothque resulting in the injury of american military personnel and death of one serviceman stating that there was irrefutable proof that libya had directed the terrorist bombing reagan authorized the use of force against the country in the late evening of april the united states launched a series of air strikes on ground targets in libya the uk prime minister margaret thatcher allowed the us air force to use britains air bases to launch the attack on the justification that the uk was supporting americas right to selfdefense under article of the united nations charter the attack was designed to halt gaddafis ability to export terrorism offering him incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior the president addressed the nation from the oval office after the attacks had commenced stating when our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes we will respond so long as im in this office the attack was condemned by many countries by a vote of in favor to against with abstentions the united nations general assembly adopted resolution which condemns the military attack perpetrated against the socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya on april which constitutes a violation of the charter of the united nations and of international law reagan signed the immigration reform and control act in the act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants required employers to attest to their employees immigration status and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the united states before january and had lived in the country continuously critics argue that the employer sanctions were without teeth and failed to stem illegal immigration upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished statue of liberty reagan said the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and ultimately if they choose they may become americans reagan also said the employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element it will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here in the irancontra affair became a problem for the administration stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to iran during the iraniraq war to fund the contra rebels fighting against the government in nicaragua which had been specifically outlawed by an act of congress the affair became a political scandal in the united states during the s the international court of justice whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the united states ruled that the united states had violated international law and breached treaties in nicaragua in various ways see nicaragua v united states president reagan professed that he was unaware of the plots existence he opened his own investigation and appointed two republicans and one democrat john tower brent scowcroft and edmund muskie known as the tower commission to investigate the scandal the commission could not find direct evidence that reagan had prior knowledge of the program but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff making the diversion of funds possible a separate report by congress concluded that if the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing he should have reagans popularity declined from to in less than a week the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president the scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within reagans staff and eleven convictions many central americans criticize reagan for his support of the contras calling him an anticommunist zealot blinded to human rights abuses while others say he saved central america daniel ortega sandinistan and president of nicaragua said that he hoped god would forgive reagan for his dirty war against nicaragua until the early s the united states had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the soviets but the gap had been narrowed although the soviet union did not accelerate military spending after president reagans military buildup their large military expenses in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing were a heavy burden for the soviet economy at the same time saudi arabia increased oil production which resulted in a drop of oil prices in to onethird of the previous level oil was the main source of soviet export revenues these factors contributed to a stagnant soviet economy during gorbachevs tenure reagan recognized the change in the direction of the soviet leadership with mikhail gorbachev and shifted to diplomacy with a view to encourage the soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements reagans personal mission was to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons which he regarded as totally irrational totally inhumane good for nothing but killing possibly destructive of life on earth and civilization he was able to start discussions on nuclear disarmament with general secretary gorbachev gorbachev and reagan held four summit conferences between and the first in geneva switzerland the second in reykjavk iceland the third in washington dc and the fourth in moscow reagan believed that if he could persuade the soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech this would lead to reform and the end of communism speaking at the berlin wall on june reagan challenged gorbachev to go further saying general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall before gorbachevs visit to washington dc for the third summit in the soviet leader announced his intention to pursue significant arms agreements the timing of the announcement led western diplomats to contend that gorbachev was offering major concessions to the united states on the levels of conventional forces nuclear weapons and policy in eastern europe he and reagan signed the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty inf at the white house which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons the two leaders laid the framework for the strategic arms reduction treaty or start i reagan insisted that the name of the treaty be changed from strategic arms limitation talks to strategic arms reduction talks when reagan visited moscow for the fourth summit in he was viewed as a celebrity by the soviets a journalist asked the president if he still considered the soviet union the evil empire no he replied i was talking about another time another era at gorbachevs request reagan gave a speech on free markets at the moscow state university in his autobiography an american life reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for gorbachev in november ten months after reagan left office the berlin wall was opened the cold war was unofficially declared over at the malta summit on december and two years later the soviet union collapsed early in his presidency reagan started wearing a custom technologically advanced hearing aid first in his right ear and later in his left as well his decision to go public in regarding his wearing the small audioamplifying device boosted their sales on july reagan underwent surgery at bethesda naval hospital to remove cancerous polyps from his colon he relinquished presidential power to the vice president for eight hours in a similar procedure as outlined in the th amendment which he specifically avoided invoking the surgery lasted just under three hours and was successful reagan resumed the powers of the presidency later that day in august of that year he underwent an operation to remove skin cancer cells from his nose in october additional skin cancer cells were detected on his nose and removed in january reagan underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate which caused further worries about his health no cancerous growths were found however and he was not sedated during the operation in july of that year aged he underwent a third skin cancer operation on his nose on january reagan underwent surgery at walter reed army medical center to repair a dupuytrens contracture of the ring finger of his left hand the surgery lasted for more than three hours and was performed under regional anesthesia this procedure was done just thirteen days before he left office for this reason he had a hand and finger bandage the day of his farewell speech and the day of the inauguration of george h w bush during his campaign reagan pledged that if given the opportunity he would appoint the first female supreme court justice that opportunity came in his first year in office when he nominated sandra day oconnor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of justice potter stewart in his second term reagan elevated william rehnquist to succeed warren e burger as chief justice and named antonin scalia to fill the vacant seat reagan nominated conservative jurist robert bork to the high court in senator ted kennedy a democrat of massachusetts strongly condemned bork and great controversy ensued borks nomination was rejected reagan then nominated douglas ginsburg but ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use anthony kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place along with his three supreme court appointments reagan appointed judges to the united states courts of appeals and judges to the united states district courts reagan also nominated vaughn walker who would later be revealed to be the earliest known gay federal judge to the united states district court for the central district of california however the nomination stalled in the senate and walker was not confirmed until he was renominated by reagans successor george hw bush early in his tenure reagan appointed clarence m pendleton jr of san diego as the first african american to chair the united states commission on civil rights pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with reagans views on social and civil rights policy during his time as tenure from until his sudden death in pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists when he ridiculed the comparable worth proposal as being looney tunes in reagan commuted the year sentence of former louisiana commissioner of agriculture and forestry gil dozier a democrat from baton rouge to the time served for violations of both the hobbs and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations acts on september the united states district court for the middle district of louisiana convicted dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf reagan determined that the year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving after leaving office in the reagans purchased a home in bel air los angeles in addition to the reagan ranch in santa barbara they regularly attended bel air presbyterian church and occasionally made appearances on behalf of the republican party reagan delivered a wellreceived speech at the republican national convention previously on november the ronald reagan presidential library was dedicated and opened to the public at the dedication ceremonies five presidents were in attendance as well as six first ladies marking the first time that five presidents were gathered in the same location reagan continued publicly to speak in favor of a lineitem veto the brady bill a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the repeal of the nd amendment which prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president in reagan established the ronald reagan freedom award with the newly formed ronald reagan presidential foundation his final public speech was on february during a tribute to him in washington dc and his last major public appearance was at the funeral of richard nixon on april  in august at the age of reagan was diagnosed with alzheimers disease an incurable neurological disorder which destroys brain cells and ultimately causes death in november he informed the nation through a handwritten letter writing in part i have recently been told that i am one of the millions of americans who will be afflicted with alzheimers disease at the moment i feel just fine i intend to live the remainder of the years god gives me on this earth doing the things i have always done i now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life i know that for america there will always be a bright dawn ahead thank you my friends may god always bless you after his diagnosis letters of support from wellwishers poured into his california home but there was also speculation over how long reagan had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration former cbs white house correspondent lesley stahl recounted that in her final meeting with the president in reagan did not seem to know who stahl was and that she came close to reporting that reagan was senile but at the end of the meeting reagan had regained his alertness however dr lawrence k altman a physician employed as a reporter for the new york times noted that the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of alzheimers can be fuzzy and all four of reagans white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimers while he was president dr john e hutton reagans primary physician from to said the president absolutely did not show any signs of dementia or alzheimers his former chief of staff james baker considered ludicrous the idea that reagan slept during cabinet meetings other staff members former aides and friends said they saw no indication of alzheimers while he was president reagan did experience occasional memory lapses though especially with names reagans doctors say that he only began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late or several years after he had left office for example reagan repeated a toast to margaret thatcher with identical words and gestures at his ndbirthday party on feb  complicating the picture reagan suffered an episode of head trauma in july five years before his diagnosis after being thrown from a horse in mexico a subdural hematoma was found and surgically treated later in the year nancy reagan citing what doctors told her asserts that her husbands fall hastened the onset of alzheimers disease although acute brain injury has not been conclusively proven to accelerate alzheimers or dementia reagans onetime physician daniel ruge has said it is possible but not certain that the horse accident affected the course of reagans memory as the years went on the disease slowly destroyed reagans mental capacity he was only able to recognize a few people including his wife nancy he remained active however he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches played golf regularly and until he often went to his office in nearby century city reagan suffered a fall at his bel air home on january resulting in a broken hip the fracture was repaired the following day and the yearold reagan returned home later that week although he faced difficult physical therapy at home on february reagan reached the age of becoming the third former president to do so the other two being john adams and herbert hoover with gerald ford george h w bush and jimmy carter later reaching reagans public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease and as a result his family decided that he would live in quiet semiisolation with his wife nancy nancy reagan told cnns larry king in that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that ronnie would want people to remember him as he was after her husbands diagnosis and death nancy reagan became a stemcell research advocate urging congress and president george w bush to support federal funding for embryonic stemcell research something bush opposed in she praised president barack obama for lifting restrictions on such research mrs reagan has said that she believes that it could lead to a cure for alzheimers reagan died of pneumonia complicated by alzheimers disease at his home in bel air california on the afternoon of june a short time after his death nancy reagan released a statement saying my family and i would like the world to know that president ronald reagan has died after years of alzheimers disease at years of age we appreciate everyones prayers president george w bush declared june a national day of mourning and international tributes came in from around the world reagans body was taken to the kingsley and gates funeral home in santa monica california later in the day where wellwishers paid tribute by laying flowers and american flags in the grass on june his body was removed and taken to the ronald reagan presidential library where a brief family funeral was held conducted by pastor michael wenning his body lay in repose in the library lobby until june over people viewed the coffin on june reagans body was flown to washington dc where he became the tenth united states president to lie in state in thirtyfour hours people filed past the coffin on june a state funeral was conducted in the washington national cathedral and presided over by president george w bush eulogies were given by former british prime minister margaret thatcher former canadian prime minister brian mulroney and both former president george h w bush and president george w bush also in attendance were mikhail gorbachev and many world leaders including british prime minister tony blair prince charles representing his mother queen elizabeth ii german chancellor gerhard schrder italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and interim presidents hamid karzai of afghanistan and ghazi alyawer of iraq after the funeral the reagan entourage was flown back to the ronald w reagan presidential library in simi valley california where another service was held and president reagan was interred at the time of his death reagan was the longestlived president in us history having lived years and days years months and days longer than john adams whose record he surpassed he is now the second longestlived president just days fewer than gerald ford he was the first united states president to die in the st century and his was the first state funeral in the united states since that of president lyndon b johnson in  his burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered at the opening of the ronald reagan presidential library i know in my heart that man is good that what is right will always eventually triumph and that there is purpose and worth to each and every life since reagan left office in substantial debate has occurred among scholars historians and the general public surrounding his legacy supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of reagans economic policies foreign policy triumphs including a peaceful end to the cold war and a restoration of american pride and morale proponents also argue reagan restored faith in the american dream with his unabated and passionate love for the united states after a decline in american confidence and selfrespect under jimmy carters perceived weak leadership particularly during the iranian hostage crisis as well as his gloomy dreary outlook for the future of the united states during the election critics contend that reagans economic policies resulted in rising budget deficits a wider gap in wealth and an increase in homelessness and that the irancontra affair lowered american credibility opinions of reagans legacy among the countrys leading policy makers and journalists differ as well edwin feulner president of the heritage foundation said that reagan helped create a safer freer world and said of his economic policies he took an america suffering from malaise and made its citizens believe again in their destiny however mark weisbrot codirector of the center for economic and policy research contended that reagans economic policies were mostly a failure while howard kurtz of the washington post opined that reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d roosevelt leaving his imprint on american politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication dedicated patriotism and pragmatic compromising since he left office historians have reached a consensus as summarized by british historian m j heale who finds that scholars now concur that reagan rehabilitated conservatism turned the nation to the right practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics revived faith in the presidency and in american exceptionalism and contributed to victory in the cold war the cold war was a major political economic and military endeavor for over four decades but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically by the end of reagans presidency the significance of reagans role in ending the cold war has spurred contentious and opinionated debate that reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the soviet union is agreed but the extent of this role is continuously debated with many believing that reagans defense policies economic policies military policies and hard line rhetoric against the soviet union and communism as well as summits with general secretary gorbachev played a significant part in ending the cold war he was first among postworld war ii presidents to put into practice the concept that the soviet union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with a postdtente strategy a conviction that was vindicated by gennadi gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman under gorbachev who said that the strategic defense initiative was very successful blackmail the soviet economy couldnt endure such competition reagans aggressive rhetoric toward the ussr had mixed effects jeffery w knopf observes that being labeled evil probably made no difference to the soviets but gave encouragement to the easteuropean citizens opposed to communism general secretary gorbachev said of his former rivals cold war role he was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the cold war and deemed him a great president gorbachev does not acknowledge a win or loss in the war but rather a peaceful end he said he was not intimidated by reagans harsh rhetoric margaret thatcher former prime minister of the united kingdom said of reagan he warned that the soviet union had an insatiable drive for military power but he also sensed it was being eaten away by systemic failures impossible to reform she later said ronald reagan had a higher claim than any other leader to have won the cold war for liberty and he did it without a shot being fired said brian mulroney former prime minister of canada he enters history as a strong and dramatic player in the cold war former president lech wasa of poland acknowledged reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communisms collapse that reagan had little or no effect in ending the cold war is argued with equal weight that communisms internal weakness had become apparent and the soviet union would have collapsed in the end regardless of who was in power president harry s trumans policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the ussr and the soviet invasion of afghanistan undermined the soviet system itself ronald reagan reshaped the republican party led the modern conservative movement and altered the political dynamic of the united states more men voted republican under reagan and reagan tapped into religious voters the socalled reagan democrats were a result of his presidency after leaving office reagan became an iconic influence within the republican party his policies and beliefs

the nations trajectory i think ronald reagan changed the trajectory of america in a way that richard nixon did not and in a way that bill clinton did not he put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it i think they felt like with all the excesses of the s and s and government had grown and grown but there wasnt much sense of accountability in terms of how it was

abusive and secret way in a may speech in the senate wyden sharply criticized the use of patriot act stating the fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the patriot act and yet many members of congress have no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch because that interpretation is classified its almost as if there were two patriot acts and many members of congress have not read the one that matters our constituents of course are totally in the dark members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means in an interview for the documentary dirty wars the world is a battlefield wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations or targeted killings of american citizens by their government and responded that the american people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret but that he is not permitted to disclose the difference publicly after the guardian reported the existence of a nsa datamining program called boundless informant in june wyden said since government officials have repeatedly told the public and congress that patriot act authorities are simply analogous to a grand jury subpoena and that

capital gains tax to encourage the study of the flat tax and to require a majority to raise taxes however wyden voted against the bush tax cuts passed in and he has also voted against the balanced budget amendment wyden supports lower corporate taxes and was generally supportive of the draft proposal for deficit reduction that was released by the chairmen of the national commission on fiscal responsibility and reform in november  wyden has been praised by len burman of the tax policy center as a legislator who has worked tirelessly to try to advance the cause of tax reform despite having few allies in this quest on november wyden announced he would take the steps necessary to put a hold on the combating online infringement and counterfeits act coica so it is not enacted into law that year if it were enacted it would allow the attorney general the authority to order internet providers in the us to block access to websites that were deemed to contain copyright infringement this effectively requires the law to be resubmitted next year rather than be rushed through the system at the end of the congress he stated it seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem but it seems to me that coica as written is the wrong medicine deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunkerbusting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precisionguided missile the collateral damage of this statute could be american innovation american jobs and a secure internet in june wyden announced his geolocation privacy and surveillance act in partnership with representative jason chaffetz rutah the bill which is still under house consideration would establish a legal framework for the sharing and access of private tracking data by corporations individuals and federal agencies wyden was the first politician in congress to stand against the controversial stop online piracy act sopa in the house and the protect ip act pipa in the senate on the grounds that it would step towards an internet in which those with money and lawyers and access to power have a greater voice than those who dont wyden delayed the pipa in the senate by placing a hold on the legislation in which prevented the bill from being considered by the full senate even after it was unanimously voted out of the senate judiciary committee wydens hold was credited with giving time for the internet to rally against sopa and pipa with representative darrell issa in the house wyden also introduced the online protection and enforcement of digital trade act as an alternative to sopa and pipa ezra klein wrote perhaps no single member of congress deserves as much credit for slowing the advance of the bills than wyden who for much of fought a oneman battle to keep the senate version of the legislation from moving through on a unanimous vote wyden was described as the primary driver of opposition to the bill within the senate when senate leadership announced it was indefinitely postponing the bill following massive protests in january wyden called it a grassroots victory for the history books for his role in fighting against sopa and

extortion labor racketeering and murder for hire time magazine called this case of cases possibly the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the chicago mafia was swept away in and quoted giulianis stated intention our approach is to wipe out the five families eight defendants were found guilty on all counts and subsequently sentenced on january to hundreds of years of prison time according to an fbi memo revealed about years later leaders of the five new york mob families voted in on whether to issue a contract for the death of us attorney rudolph giuliani heads of the lucchese bonanno and genovese families rejected the idea though gambino leader john gotti encouraged assassination ivan boesky was a wall street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about million by betting on corporate takeovers he was investigated by the us securities and exchange commission sec for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders these stock acquisitions were sometimes brazen with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover although insider trading of this kind was illegal laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until boesky was prosecuted boesky cooperated with the sec and informed on several others including junk bond trader michael milken per agreement with giuliani boesky received a year prison sentence along with a million fine in giuliani charged milken under the rico act with counts of racketeering and fraud in a highly publicized case milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges giuliani was us attorney until january resigning as the reagan administration ended he garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions he joined the law firm white case in new york city as a partner he remained with white case until may when he joined the law firm anderson kill olick oshinsky also in new york city giuliani first ran for new york city mayor in attempting to unseat threeterm incumbent ed koch he won the september republican party primary election against business magnate ronald lauder in a campaign marked by claims that giuliani was not a true republican and by an acrimonious debate in the democratic primary koch was upset by manhattan borough president david dinkins in the general election giuliani ran as the fusion candidate of both the republican and liberal parties the conservative party which had often colined the republican party candidate withheld support from giuliani and ran lauder instead conservative party leaders were unhappy with giuliani on ideological grounds they cited the liberal partys endorsement statement that giuliani agreed with the liberal partys views on affirmative action gay rights gun control school prayer and tuition tax credits during two televised debates giuliani framed himself as an agent of change saying im the reformer that if we keep going merrily along this citys going down and that electing dinkins would represent more of the same more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down giuliani pointed out that dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and of several other ethical missteps in particular a stock transfer to his son dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off denied other wrongdoing and said that what we need is a mayor not a prosecutor and that giuliani refused to say the rwordhe doesnt like to admit hes a republican dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily new york newspapers while giuliani won approval from the new york post in the end giuliani lost to dinkins by a margin of votes out of votes cast in the closest election in new york citys history the closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy considering the small percentage of new york city residents who are registered republicans and resulted in giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with dinkins at the next election four years after he was beaten by dinkins giuliani again ran for mayor once again giuliani also ran on the liberal party line but not the conservative party line which ran activist george marlin the city was suffering from a spike in unemployment associated with the nationwide recession with local unemployment rates going from in to in and a sharp spike in crime with record numbers of murders and other violent crimes giuliani promised to focus the police department on shutting down petty crimes and nuisances as a way of restoring the quality of life its the street tax paid to drunks and panhandlers its the squeegee men shaking down the motorist waiting at a light its the trash storms the swirling mass of garbage left by peddlers and panhandlers and openair drug bazaars on unclean streets dinkins and giuliani never debated during the campaign because they were never able to agree on how to approach a debate dinkins was endorsed by the new york times and newsday while giuliani was endorsed by the new york post and in a key switch from the daily news giuliani came to visit the late lubavitcher rebbe rabbi menachem mendel schneerson seeking his blessing and endorsement giuliani won by a margin of votes he became the first republican elected mayor of new york city since john lindsay in  giulianis opponent in was democratic manhattan borough president ruth messinger who had beaten al sharpton in the september democratic primary in the general election giuliani once again had the liberal party and not the conservative party listing giuliani ran an aggressive campaign parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city giulianis popularity was at its highest point to date with a late october quinnipiac university polling institute poll showing him as having a percent approval rating percent of new yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fundraising advantage over messinger on her part messinger lost the support of several usually democratic constituencies including gay organizations and large labor unions the local daily newspapersthe new york times daily news new york post and newsdayall endorsed giuliani over messinger in the end giuliani won of the vote to messingers and became the first registered republican to win a second term as mayor while on the republican line since fiorello h la guardia in voter turnout was the lowest in years with of registered voters casting ballots the margin of victory included gains in his share of the african american vote compared to s and the hispanic vote from while maintaining his base of white ethnic catholic and jewish voters from  giuliani served as mayor of new york city from through  in giulianis first term as mayor the new york city police department at the instigation of commissioner bill bratton adopted an aggressive enforcementdeterrent strategy based on james q wilsons broken windows approach this involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti turnstile jumping cannabis possession and aggressive panhandling by squeegee men on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained the legal underpinning for removing the squeegee men from the streets was developed under giulianis predecessor mayor david dinkins bratton with deputy commissioner jack maple also created and instituted compstat a computerdriven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data the compstat initiative won the innovations in government award from the kennedy school of government during giulianis administration crime rates continued to drop in new york city which giulianis presidential campaign website credited to his leadership the extent to which giuliani deserves the credit is disputed crime rates in new york city had started to drop in under previous mayor david dinkins three years before giuliani took office under dinkinss safe streets safe cities program crime in new york city decreased more dramatically and more rapidly both in terms of actual numbers and percentage than at any time in modern new york city history the rates of most crimes including all categories of violent crime made consecutive declines during the last months of dinkinss fouryear term ending a year upward spiral a small nationwide drop in crime preceded giulianis election and critics say that he may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress additional contributing factors to the overall decline in new york city crime during the s were the addition of officers to the nypd lobbied for and hired by the dinkins administration and an overall improvement in the national economy changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions which were similar across the country during this time because the crime index is based on that of the fbi which is selfreported by police departments some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories that the fbi doesnt collect giulianis supporters cite studies concluding that the decline in new york citys crime rate in the s and s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country what university of california sociologist frank zimring calls the most focused form of policing in history in his book the great american crime decline zimring argues that up to half of new yorks crime drop in the s and virtually percent of its continuing crime decline since has resulted from policing bratton was featured on the cover of time in giuliani reportedly forced bratton out after two years in what was generally seen as a battle of two large egos in which giuliani was not tolerant of brattons celebrity bratton went on to become chief of the los angeles police department giulianis term also saw allegations of civil rights abuses and other police misconduct under other commissioners after brattons departure there were police shootings of unarmed suspects and the scandals surrounding the torture of abner louima and the killings of amadou diallo and patrick dorismond giuliani supported the new york police department for example by releasing what he called dorismonds extensive criminal record to the public including a sealed juvenile file the giuliani administration advocated the privatization of failing public schools and increasing school choice through a voucherbased system giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants he continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the immigration and naturalization service about immigration violations on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation during his mayoralty gay and lesbian new yorkers received domestic partnership rights giuliani induced the citys democraticcontrolled new york city council which had avoided the issue for years to pass legislation providing broad protection for samesex partners in he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners several of giulianis appointees to head city agencies became defendants in criminal proceedings in giuliani appointed yearold russell harding the son of liberal party of new york leader and longtime giuliani mentor raymond harding to head the new york city housing development corporation although harding had neither a college degree nor relevant experience in harding pleaded guilty to defrauding the housing development corporation and to possession of child pornography he was sentenced to five years in prison russell harding committed suicide in  in a related matter richard roberts appointed by giuliani as housing commissioner and as chairman of the health and hospitals corporation pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a grand jury about a car that harding bought for him with city funds giuliani was a longtime backer of bernard kerik who started out as a nypd detective driving for giulianis campaign giuliani appointed him as the commissioner of the department of correction and then as the police commissioner giuliani was also the godfather to keriks two youngest children after giuliani left office kerik pleaded guilty to state corruption charges dating from his corrections days kerik is currently awaiting trial on related federal charges of conspiracy tax fraud and obstruction of justice giuliani has not been implicated in any of the kerik scandals due to term limits giuliani could not run in for a third term as mayor in november fourterm incumbent democratic us senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement and giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the election for the nowopen seat due to his high profile and visibility giuliani was supported by the state republican party giulianis entrance led democratic congressman charles rangel and others to recruit thenus first lady hillary rodham clinton to run for moynihans seat hoping she might combat his star power an early january poll showed giuliani trailing clinton by points in april giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the senate run by january giuliani had reversed the polls situation pulling nine points ahead after taking advantage of several campaign stumbles by clinton nevertheless the giuliani campaign was showing some structural weaknesses so closely identified with new york city he had somewhat limited appeal to normally republican voters in upstate new york the new york police departments fatal shooting of patrick dorismond in march inflamed giulianis already strained relations with the citys minority communities and clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue by april reports showed clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking giuliani who stated that his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more clinton was now to points ahead of giuliani in the polls then followed four tumultuous weeks in which giulianis medical life romantic life marital life and political life all collided at once in a most visible fashion giuliani discovered that he had prostate cancer and needed treatment his extramarital relationship with judith nathan became public and the subject of a media frenzy he announced a separation from his wife donna hanover and after much indecision on may he announced his withdrawal from the senate race giuliani has been criticized for ignoring the ongoing threat to new york city from islamist terrorism in the years between the world trade center bombings and september  prior to september giuliani reportedly never referred to the bombing publicly except for a single metaphorical reference in his inaugural address not referring to terrorism giuliani also reportedly never discussed the threat of terrorism with the us attorney in his district and had to ask henry kissinger for background information on osama bin laden after the september th attacks despite the fact that bin laden had previously declared a fatwa against the united states the clinton administration had established a section of the cia devoted exclusively to hunting bin laden jerome hauer giulianis emergency management chief between and later said that we never talked about islamic terrorism we talked about chemical terrorism biological terrorism we did talk about car bombs every now and then but i dont think there was much interest on his part in islam terrorism giuliani was prominent in the aftermath of the september attacks on the world trade center he made frequent appearances on radio and television on september and afterwardsfor example to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack in his public statements giuliani said tomorrow new york is going to be here and were going to rebuild and were going to be stronger than we were before i want the people of new york to be an example to the rest of the country and the rest of the world that terrorism cant stop us the attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the democratic and republican candidates to succeed giuliani the primary was immediately delayed two weeks to september during this period giuliani sought an unprecedented threemonth emergency extension of his term from january to april under the new york state constitution article section he threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full fouryear term if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty in the end leaders in the state assembly and senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary the election proceeded as scheduled and the winning candidate the giulianiendorsed republican convert michael bloomberg took office on january per normal custom giuliani claimed to have been at the ground zero site as often if not more than most workers i was there working with them i was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to so in that sense im one of them some workers have objected to those claims while his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks giuliani spent a total of hours over three months at the site this contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days when saudi prince alwaleed bin talal suggested that the attacks were an indication that the united states should reexamine its policies in the middle east and adopt a more balanced stand toward the palestinian cause giuliani asserted there is no moral equivalent for this act there is no justification for it and one of the reasons i think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the united states like israel and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism so i think not only are those statements wrong theyre part of the problem giuliani subsequently rejected the princes million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the office of emergency management headquarters on the rd floor inside the world trade center building those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the world trade center in the office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in world trade to power the command center in may giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on jerome m hauer who had served under giuliani from to before being appointed by him as new york citys first director of emergency management hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided fox news and new york magazine with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in brooklyn but was overruled by giuliani television journalist chris wallace interviewed giuliani on may about his decision to locate the command center at the world trade center giuliani laughed during wallaces questions and said that hauer recommended the world trade center site and claimed that hauer said that the wtc site was the best location wallace presented giuliani a photocopy of hauers directive letter the letter urged giuliani to locate the command center in brooklyn instead of lower manhattan the february memo read the brooklyn building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in lower manhattan in january an eightpage memo was revealed which detailed the new york city police departments opposition in to location of the citys emergency command center at the trade center site the giuliani administration overrode these concerns the commission report noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks the commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the world trade center bombings family members of victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years the radios were not working when fire department chiefs ordered the firefighters inside the towers to evacuate and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed however when giuliani testified before the commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives giuliani testified to the commission where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements a mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty replacement radios were purchased in a million nobid contract with motorola and implemented in early however the radios were recalled in march after a probationary firefighters calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene leaving firemen with the old analog radios from a book later published by commission members thomas kean and lee h hamilton without precedent the inside story of the commission argued that the commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with giuliani an october study by the national institute of environmental safety and health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear in the wake of the attacks giuliani gained international attention and was widely hailed for his leadership during the crisis when polled just six weeks after the attack giuliani received a percent approval rating among new york city voters a dramatic increase over the percent rating he had received a year earlieraverage at the end of a twoterm mayorship oprah winfrey called him americas mayor at a memorial service held at yankee stadium on september other voices denied it was the mayor who had pulled the city together you didnt bring us together our pain brought us together and our decency brought us together we would have come together if bozo was the mayor said civil rights activist al sharpton in a statement largely supported by fernando ferrer one of three main candidates for the mayoralty at the end of he was a powerhungry person sharpton also said on december time magazine named giuliani its person of the year for time observed that prior to the public image of giuliani had been that of a rigid selfrighteous ambitious politician after and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis historian vincent j cannato concluded in september  with time giulianis legacy will be based on more than just he left a city immeasurably better offsafer more prosperous more confidentthan the one he had inherited eight years earlier even with the smoldering ruins of the world trade center at its heart debates about his accomplishments will continue but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts but others argue that giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks casting himself as a hero for political gain giuliani has collected million from speaking fees in a single year his demand increasing after the attacks before september giulianis assets were estimated to be somewhat less than million but his net worth could now be as high as times that amount he has made most of his money since leaving office for his leadership on and after september giuliani was given an honorary knighthood kbe by queen elizabeth ii on february  giuliani initially downplayed the health effects arising from the september attacks in the financial district and lower manhattan areas in the vicinity of the world trade center site he moved quickly to reopen wall street and it was reopened on september in the first month after the attacks he said the air quality is safe and acceptable however in the weeks after the attacks the united states geological survey identified hundreds of asbestos hot spots of debris dust that remained on buildings by the end of the month the usgs reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner it would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower manhattan and brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials the citys health agencies such as the department of environmental protection did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings instead the city left this responsibility to building owners giuliani took control away from agencies such as the federal emergency management agency the army corps of engineers and the occupational safety and health administration leaving the largely unknown city department of design and construction in charge of recovery and cleanup documents indicate that the giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators concurrently the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed in june christie todd whitman former republican governor of new jersey and director of the environmental protection agency epa reportedly stated that the epa had pushed for workers at the wtc site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by giuliani she stated that she believed that the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by wtc responders were a result of these actions however former deputy mayor joe lhota then with the giuliani campaign replied all workers at ground zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators giuliani asked the citys congressional delegation to limit the citys liability for ground zero illnesses be limited to a total of million two years after giuliani finished his term fema appropriated billion to a special insurance fund called the world trade center captive insurance company to protect the city against lawsuits in february the international association of fire fighters issued a letter asserting that giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from world trade center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered mayor giulianis actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at ground zero forever with no closure for families or be removed like garbage and deposited at the fresh kills landfill it said adding hundreds remained entombed in ground zero when giuliani gave up on them lawyers for the international association of fire fighters seek to interview giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that new york city negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the fresh kills landfill since leaving office as mayor giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for republican candidates for political offices at all levels as the first republicans to simultaneously serve as mayor and governor of new york since nelson rockefeller and john lindsay giuliani and governor george pataki were instrumental in bringing the republican national convention to new york city he was a speaker at the convention and endorsed president george w bush for reelection by recalling that immediately after the world trade center towers fell without really thinking based on just emotion spontaneous i grabbed the arm of thenpolice commissioner bernard kerik and i said to him bernie thank god george bush is our president similarly in june giuliani started a website called solutions america to help elect republican candidates across the nation after campaigning on bushs behalf in the us presidential election of he was reportedly the top choice for secretary of homeland security after tom ridges resignation when suggestions were made that giulianis confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former new york police commissioner bernard kerik after the formal announcement of keriks nomination information about keriks pastmost notably that he had ties to organized crime failed to properly report gifts he had received had been sued for sexual harassment and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servantbecame known and kerik withdrew his nomination in november giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for president of the united states in in february he filed a statement of candidacy and confirmed on the television program larry king live that he was indeed running early polls showed giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition and support among the republican candidates throughout most of he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among republicans senator john mccain who ranked a close second behind the new york mayor had faded and most polls showed giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared republican candidates with only former senator fred thompson and former governor mitt romney showing greater support in some perstate republican polls on november giulianis campaign received an endorsement from evangelist christian broadcasting network founder and past presidential candidate pat robertson this was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights giulianis campaign hit a difficult stretch during november and december during which time bernard kerik whom giuliani had recommended for the position of secretary of homeland security was indicted on counts of tax fraud and other federal charges the media reported that while mayor of new york giuliani had billed to obscure city agencies several tens of thousands of dollars of mayoral security expenses incurred while visiting judith nathan with whom he was having an extramarital affair later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding nathan and several stories were published in the press regarding clients of giuliani partners and bracewell giuliani being in opposition to goals of american foreign policy giulianis national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later multiprimary big states rather than the smaller firstvoting states was seen at risk despite his strategy giuliani did compete to a substantial extent in the january new hampshire primary but finished a distant fourth with percent of the vote similar poor results continued in other early contests as giulianis staff went without pay in order to focus all efforts on the crucial late january florida republican primary the shift of the electorates focus from national security to the state of the economy also hurt giuliani as did the resurgence of mccains similarly themed campaign on january giuliani finished a distant third in the florida result with percent of the vote trailing mccain and romney facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large super tuesday states including that of his home new york giuliani withdrew from the race on january endorsing mccain giulianis campaign ended up million in arrears and in june giuliani sought to retire the debt by proposing to appear at republican fundraisers during the general election and have part of the proceeds go towards his campaign during the republican national convention giuliani gave a primetime speech that praised mccain and his running mate sarah palin while criticizing democratic nominee barack obama he cited palins executive experience as a mayor and governor and belittled obamas lack of same and his remarks were met with wild applause from the delegates giuliani continued to be one of mccains most active surrogates during the remainder of mccains eventually unsuccessful campaign following the end of his presidential campaign giulianis high appearance fees dropped like a stone he returned to work at both giuliani partners and bracewell giuliani giuliani explored hosting a syndicated radio show and was reported to be in talks with westwood one about replacing bill oreilly before that position went to fred thompson another unsuccessful gop presidential primary candidate during the march aig bonus payments controversy giuliani called for us treasury secretary tim geithner to step down and said that the obama administration lacked executive competence in dealing with the ongoing financial crisis giuliani said his political career was not necessarily over and did not rule out a new york gubernatorial or presidential bid a november siena college poll indicated that although governor david patersonpromoted to the office via the eliot spitzer prostitution scandal a year beforewas popular among new yorkers he would have just a slight lead over giuliani in a hypothetical matchup by february after the prolonged senate appointment process a siena college poll indicated that paterson was losing popularity among new yorkers and showed giuliani with a fifteenpoint lead in the hypothetical contest in january giuliani said he would not decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months adding that he thought it would not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt but by the end of march it was still million in arrears the largest such remaining amount for any of the contenders in april giuliani strongly opposed patersons announced push for samesex marriage in new york and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put republicans in statewide office in by late august there were still conflicting reports about whether giuliani was likely to run on december giuliani announced that he would not seek any office in saying the main reason has to do with my two enterprises bracewell giuliani and giuliani partners im very busy in both the decisions signaled a possible end to giulianis political career during the midterm elections giuliani endorsed and campaigned for bob ehrlich and marco rubio on october giuliani announced that he was not running for president according to kevin law the director of the long island association giuliani believed that as a moderate he thought it was a pretty significant challenge he said its tough to be a moderate and succeed in gop primaries giuliani said if its too late for new jersey governor chris christie its too late for me at a republican fundraising event in february giuliani stated i do not believe and i know this is a horrible thing to say but i do not believe that the president loves america and he doesnt love you and he doesnt love me he wasnt brought up the way you were brought up and i was brought up through love of this country in response to criticism of the remarks giuliani said some people thought it was racisti thought that was a joke since he was brought up by a white mother this isnt racism this is socialism or possibly anticolonialism white house deputy press secretary eric schultz said he agreed with giuliani that it was a horrible thing to say but said he would leave it up to the people who heard giuliani directly to assess if the remarks were appropriate for the event although he received some support for his controversial comments giuliani said he also received several death threats within hours on march congress formed the iraq study group isg this bipartisan tenperson panel of which giuliani was one of the members was charged with assessing the iraq war and making recommendations they would eventually unanimously conclude that contrary to bush administration assertions the situation in iraq is grave and deteriorating and called for changes in the primary mission that would allow the united states to begin to move its forces out of iraq on may after missing all of the groups meetings including a briefing from general david petraeus former secretary of state colin powell and former army chief of staff eric shinseki giuliani resigned from the panel citing previous time commitments giulianis fundraising schedule had kept him from participating in the panel a schedule which raised million in speaking fees over months and that giuliani had been forced to resign after being given an ultimatum to either show up for meetings or leave the group by group leader james baker giuliani subsequently said that he had started thinking about running for president and being on the panel might give it a political spin giuliani was described by newsweek in january as one of the most consistent cheerleaders for the presidents handling of the war in iraq and as of june remained one of the few candidates for president to unequivocally support both the basis for the invasion and the execution of the war after leaving the mayors office giuliani founded a security consulting business giuliani partners llc in a firm that has been categorized by various media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on giulianis name recognition and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by giuliani and due to the firms chosen client base over five years giuliani partners has earned more than million in june he stepped down as ceo and chairman of giuliani partners although this action was not made public until december he maintained his equity interest in the firm giuliani subsequently returned to active participation in the firm following the election in late giuliani announced that they had a

of porkbarrel spending as the island only has a population of the bridge became known as the bridge to nowhere the public furor led to congress removing the earmarks but retaining the allotted funds to alaska as part of its general transportation fund in palin ran for governor with a buildthebridge plank in her platform saying she would not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project into something thats so negative palin criticized the use of the word nowhere as insulting to local residents and urged speedy work on building the infrastructure while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist as governor palin canceled the gravina island bridge in september saying that congress had little interest in spending any more money due to inaccurate portrayals of the projects alaska did not return the million in federal transportation funds in as a vicepresidential candidate palin characterized her position as having told congress thanks but no thanks on that

federal transportation funds set aside as part of the original bridge project to continue a spokesman for alaskas department of transportation said that it was within palins power to cancel the road

public safety commissioner walt monegan on july citing performancerelated issues such as not being a team player on budgeting issues and egregious rogue behavior palin attorney thomas van flein said that the last straw was monegans planned trip to washington dc to seek funding for a new multimilliondollar sexual assault initiative the governor hadnt yet approved monegan said that he had resisted persistent pressure from palin her husband and her staff including state attorney general talis j colberg to fire palins exbrotherinlaw alaska state trooper mike wooten wooten was involved in a child custody battle with palins sister after a bitter divorce that included an alleged death threat against palins father at one point sarah and todd palin hired a private investigator to gather information seeking to have wooten officially disciplined monegan stated that he learned an internal investigation had found all but two of the allegations to be unsubstantiated and wooten had been disciplined for the others an illegal moose killing and the tasering of his yearold stepson who had reportedly asked to be tasered he told the palins that there was nothing he could do because the matter was closed when contacted by the press for comment monegan first acknowledged pressure to fire wooten but said that he could not be certain that his own firing was connected to that issue he later asserted that the dispute over wooten was a major reason for his firing palin stated on july that monegan was not pressured to fire wooten nor dismissed for not doing so monegan said the subject of wooten came up when he invited palin to a birthday party for his cousin state senator lyman hoffman in february during the legislative session in juneau as we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building she wanted to talk to me about her former brotherinlaw monegan said i said maam i need to keep you at arms length with this i cant deal about him with you she said ok thats a good idea palin said there was absolutely no pressure ever put on commissioner monegan to hire or fire anybody at any time i did not abuse my office powers and i dont know how to be more blunt and candid and honest but to tell you that truth to tell you that no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody todd palin gave a similar account on august she acknowledged that a half dozen members of her administration had made more than two dozen calls on the matter to various state officials i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it she said palin said many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction chuck kopp whom palin had appointed to replace monegan as public safety commissioner received a state severance package after he resigned following just two weeks on the job kopp the former kenai chief of police resigned july following disclosure of a sexual harassment complaint and letter of reprimand against him monegan said that he did not receive a severance package from the state on august the alaska legislature hired an investigator stephen branchflower to review the monegan dismissal legislators stated that palin had the legal authority to fire monegan but they wanted to know whether her action had been motivated by anger at monegan for not firing wooten the atmosphere was bipartisan and palin pledged to cooperate wooten remained employed as a state trooper she placed an aide on paid leave due to a taperecorded phone conversation that she deemed improper in which the aide appearing to act on her behalf complained to a trooper that wooten had not been fired several weeks after the start of what the media referred to as troopergate palin was chosen as john mccains running mate on september palin asked the legislature to drop its investigation saying that the state personnel board had jurisdiction over ethics issues the personnel boards three members were first appointed by palins predecessor and palin reappointed one member in on september todd palin and several state employees refused to honor subpoenas the validity of which were disputed by talis colberg palins appointee as alaskas attorney general on october a court rejected colbergs challenge to the subpoenas and seven of the witnesses not including todd palin eventually testified on october the alaska legislative council unanimously voted to release without endorsing the branchflower report in which investigator stephen branchflower found that firing monegan was a proper and lawful exercise of her constitutional and statutory authority but that palin abused her power as governor and violated the states executive branch ethics act when her office pressured monegan to fire wooten the report stated that governor palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates to advance a personal agenda to wit to get trooper michael wooten fired the report also said that palin permitted todd palin to use the governors office to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get trooper wooten fired on october palins attorneys responded condemning the branchflower report as misleading and wrong on the law one of palins attorneys thomas van flein said that it was an attempt to smear the governor by innuendo later that day palin did a conference call interview with various alaskan reporters where she stated well im very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing any hint of any kind of unethical activity there very pleased to be cleared of any of that the bipartisan state of alaska personnel board reviewed the matter at palins request on september the anchorage law firm of clapp peterson van flein tiemessen thorsness filed arguments of no probable cause with the personnel board on behalf of palin the personnel board retained independent counsel timothy petumenos a democrat as an investigator on october palin gave three hours of depositions with the personnel board in st louis missouri on november the state of alaska personnel board reported that there was no probable cause to believe that palin or any other state official had violated state ethical standards the report further stated that the branchflower report used the wrong statute in reaching its conclusions misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence required to properly reach findings in the matter as governor of alaska palins job approval rating ranged from a high of in may to in may  on july palin announced that she would not run for reelection in the alaska gubernatorial election and would resign before the end of the month in her announcement palin stated that since august both she and the state had been spending an insane amount of time and money million responding to opposition research foia requests and frivolous legal ethics complaints filed by political operatives against her her decision not to seek reelection and to resign from office would enable her to avoid being a lame duck politician who is ineffective and milk the taxpayers by drawing a paycheck and funding useless travels she said im not putting alaska through that contrary to most reports it has been reported that her decision had been in the works for months accelerating as it became clear that controversies and endless ethics investigations were threatening to overshadow her legislative agenda a source close to palin said attacks inside alaska and largely invisible to the national media had paralyzed her administration and she was no longer able to do the job she had been elected to do essentially the taxpayers were paying for sarah to go to work every day and defend herself palin and her husband todd had personally incurred more than in legal fees defending against ethics charges brought against her as governor even though all the complaints were dismissed lt governor sean parnell said it really had to do with the weight on her the concern she had for the cost of all the ethics investigations and the like the way that weighed on her with respect to her inability to just move forward alaskas agenda on behalf of alaskans in the current context of the environment the alaska governor transfer of power to sean parnell occurred in fairbanks on july  in december new rules governing alaska executive branch ethics stemming from palins tenure as governor took effect these include allowing for the state to pay legal costs for officials cleared of ethics violations and allowing for a family member of the governor or lieutenant governor to travel at state cost in certain circumstances  several conservative commentators met palin in the summer of some of them such as bill kristol later urged mccain to pick palin as his vice presidential running mate arguing that her presence on the ticket would provide a boost in enthusiasm among the religious right wing of the republican party while her status as an unknown on the national scene would also be a positive factor on august during a general strategy meeting steve schmidt and a few other senior advisers to the mccain campaign discussed potential vice presidential picks with the consensus settling around palin the following day the strategists advised mccain of their conclusions and he personally called palin who was at the alaska state fair on august she visited mccains vacation home near sedona arizona where she was offered the position of vicepresidential candidate according to jill hazelbaker a spokeswoman for mccain he had previously met palin at the national governors association meeting in washington in february and had come away extraordinarily impressed palin was the only prospective running mate who had a facetoface interview with mccain to discuss joining the ticket that week nonetheless palins selection was a surprise to many because a main criticism he had of obama was his lack of experience and speculation had centered

governor tom ridge on august in dayton ohio mccain announced he had chosen palin as his running mate making her the first alaskan and the second woman to run on a major us party ticket as palin was

was pregnant and that she would marry the father levi johnston during this period some republicans felt that palin was being unfairly attacked by the media timothy noah of slate magazine predicted

shortcomings and had lowered the expectations for her speech on september palin delivered a minute acceptance speech at the republican national convention that was well received and watched by more than million people a rasmussen poll taken immediately after the convention found that of americans believed that the media was trying to hurt palin with negative coverage and believed palin to be

channels sean hannity went more smoothly and focused on many of the same questions from gibsons interview palins performance in her third interview with katie couric of cbs news was widely criticized her poll numbers declined republicans expressed concern that she was becoming a political liability and some conservative commentators called for palin to resign from the presidential ticket other

campaigns strategy of sheltering palin from unscripted encounters with the press palin reportedly prepared intensively for the october vicepresidential debate with democratic vicepresidential nominee joe biden at washington university in st louis some republicans suggested that palins performance in the interviews would improve public perceptions of her debate performance by lowering expectations

greatest strength while aides were preparing the teleprompter for mccains speech they found a concession speech written for palin by george w bush speechwriter matthew scully two members of mccains

staff palin was the first guest on commentator glenn becks fox news television show on january commenting on barack obama that he would be her president and that she would assist in any way to bring progress to the nation without abandoning her conservative views in august she coined the phrase death panel to describe rationing of care as part of the proposed health care reform she stated that it would require americans such as her parents or her child with down syndrome to stand in front of obamas death panel so his bureaucrats can decide based on a subjective judgment of their level of

get to be a completely red state and work on these unions and become a righttowork state and he replied well were going to start in a couple weeks with our budget adjustment bill the first step is were going to deal with collective bargaining for all public employee unions because you use divide and conquer so for us the base weve got for that is the fact that weve got budgetarily we cant afford not to if we have collective bargaining agreements in place theres no way not only the state but local governments can balance things out so you think city of beloit city of janesville any of the school districts that opens the door once we do that thats your bigger problem right there after video tape of the interaction was released in may walkers opponents said walker had revealed his intention to target private sector unions and pursue righttowork legislation walker said he was not pursuing righttowork legislation and that in his comment to hendricks he was referring to his responsibility as governor to defend taxpayers from unions that he believed were frustrating resolution of the states budget deficit in announcing the proposed legislation walker said the wisconsin national guard and other state agencies were prepared to prevent disruptions in state services he later explained that police and firefighters were excluded from the changes because he would not jeopardize public safety walker stated that the bill was necessary to avoid laying off thousands of state employees and that no one should be surprised by its provisions union leaders and democratic legislators immediately criticized the bill claiming walker had never campaigned on doing away with collective bargaining rights in a media interview a week later walker said he was not trying to break the public sector unions noting that wisconsin government employees would retain the protections of civil service laws he said that asking employees to pay half the national average for health care benefits was a modest request demonstrators began protesting the proposed bill on february during the sixth day of the protests leaders of the two largest unions said publicly they were prepared to accept the financial concessions in the bill but would not agree to the limitations of collective bargaining rights all of the democratic state senators left the state to illinois on february

cuts would be needed to balance the budget appearing on meet the press on february walker stated that he did not believe the unions were negotiating in good faith in offering pension and healthcare concessions because local unions had recently pushed through contracts with school boards and city councils that did not include contributions to the pensions and health care and that in one case a contract even included a pay increase on february the largest public union filed an unfair labor practices complaint with the state labor relations board claiming that walker had a duty to negotiate but had refused on march private emails dating back to february were released these emails showed that governor walker had tried to negotiate with democratic legislators even proposing to allow some collective bargaining rights however after failing to reach a compromise with democratic legislators the republican senate legislators removed certain fiscal provisions from the bill allowing it to be passed by a simple senate majority on march judge maryann sumi issued a court order to prohibit publication of the bill by the secretary of state while legal challenges to it were being considered on march the legislative reference bureau lrb published the bill republicans contended the court order did not mention the lrb which is also responsible for publishing laws and that the publication made the bill law democrats maintained the bill could not become law until the secretary of state took action and the entire law was published in the state newspaper of record the wisconsin state journal judge sumi subsequently clarified that pursuant to her order the bill could not be considered to be published pending completion of court review on may judge sumi struck down the budget repair bill finding that its passage was in violation of state open meetings laws the wisconsin supreme court overturned sumis ruling on june  walker claimed the measures would save jobs protect taxpayers reform government and help balance the budget he added you see despite a lot of the rhetoric weve heard over the past days the bill i put forward isnt aimed at state workers and it certainly isnt a battle with unions if it was we would have eliminated collective bargaining entirely or we would have gone after the privatesector unions as part of the cost savings resulting from the changes to collective bargaining walker points to significant reductions in the premiums for health insurance for many school districts prior to the deficit reduction bill wea trust which is affiliated with wisconsins largest teachers union dominated the market for health insurance for the states school districts the changes to collective bargaining made it easier for school districts to change health insurance providers and negotiate better premiums walker claims that wisconsin school districts have saved an estimated million as a result of the change in august the first investigation which had been launched by john chisholm milwaukee county district attorney a democrat into missing funds was rolled into a second john doe probe based on a theory that governor walkers campaign had illegally coordinated with conservative groups engaged in issue advocacy during the recall elections the initial john doe judge retired kenosha county circuit judge barbara a kluka overseeing the john doe investigation issued subpoenas and search warrants she also issued a secrecy order which meant those being investigated were legally bound from discussing any facet of the investigation publicly on

violated campaign finance laws on july the wisconsin supreme court ruled that walker did not illegally collaborate with conservative groups during the recall campaigns writing for the majority in the

the constitution and this republic in the same speech cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient roman senator cicero against catiline to denounce obamas planned executive actions on immigration reform classics professor jesse weiner writing in the atlantic said that cruzs analogy was deeply disquieting because in casting obama in the role of catiline cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the governmentin effect he accuses the president of high treason regardless of ones views on immigration reform and the obama administration at large this is dangerous rhetoric cruz has repeatedly said that the international nuclear agreement with iran will make the obama administration the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism in response obama called cruzs statements an example of outrageous attacks from republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse weve had a sitting senator who also happens to be running for president suggest that im the leading state sponsor of terrorism maybe this is just an effort to push mr trump out of the headlines but its not the kind of leadership that is needed for america right now former republican presidential nominee mitt romney also criticized cruz for his remarks writing that although he too was opposed to

march mccain also called cruz and others wacko birds whose beliefs are not reflective of the views of the majority of republicans during the republican presidential primaries john boehner described cruz as lucifer in the flesh while during an interview lindsey graham was quoted as saying if you killed ted cruz on the floor of the senate and the trial was in the senate nobody would convict you in a heated senate floor speech in july cruz accused senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of telling a flatout lie over his intentions to reauthorize the exportimport bank of the united states which cruz opposes what we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every republican senator but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie cruz said of senate republican leader mcconnell cruzs incendiary outburst was unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the senate according to reuters in the same speech cruz assailed the republican majority in both houses of congresses for what cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record cruzs speech and especially his accusation against mcconnell was condemned by various senior republican senators

persuade democrats like maria cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill whereas mcconnell denied there was any deal and that denial is what cruz termed a lie hatch says mcconnell did pledge to help cantwell get a vote on the exim bank among cruzs few close allies in the senate is mike lee of utah cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies saying in june that he has been vilified for fighting the washington cartel when boehner announced in september that he would step down and resign from the house cruz expressed his concern that before resigning boehner may have cut

his unsuccessful bid for the us house of representatives after receiving his mba degree in carper went to work for the state of delawares economic development office in after developing good relationships with members of the state party leadership he took out a personal loan to fund his campaign for the treasurer of delaware after convincing the party leaders and later the voters that he was the right person to be delaware state treasurer he defeated the favored republican party candidate theodore jones he served three terms from january through january during which time he oversaw the development of delawares first cash management system it took a considerable amount of persuasion on the part of us senator joe biden and others to convince carper to leave his obscure but safe position as treasurer and compete for delawares only seat in the us house of representatives in thomas b evans jr the incumbent republican was running again and although he had been caught in a compromising association on a golfing trip with the young lobbyist paula parkinson he was still a formidable and wellconnected politician the campaign was going well for carper until three weeks before election day when the new york post published an article claiming that the dirtiest campaign in the country is being waged in tiny delaware retelling the wellknown story of evans golfing trip it went on to accuse carper of abusing his wife and stepchildren but the story actually ended up working to carpers political advantage when suspicions spread that the allegations had been planted by an evans supporter and when public opinion seemed to conclude that the allegations were inappropriately exploiting a private issue carper went on to serve five terms in the us house of representatives he won his second term in by defeating elise rw du pont the wife of former governor pierre s du pont iv he then enjoyed easy victories over republicans thomas s neuberger in james p krapf in and ralph

subcommittee on economic stabilization in these positions he worked to allow banks into the securities business and to discourage the dumping of sludge into the ocean during his years in the us house of representatives carper sought to gain better control of the democratic party organization in delaware in hopes of someday becoming governor heavily democratic and with over half of the population of the state new castle county was the key its democratic organization was controlled by eugene t reed a former ironworker and an oldtime political party boss who was then among several politicians in both parties implicated in illegal money raising practices to address this corruption and rescue the reputation of the democratic party carper recruited joseph e reardon a dupont company chemist as a candidate for new castle county democratic party chairman by early he had succeeded in getting reardon elected and reardon replaced reed at the head of a newly reformed party organization in carper faced a primary challenge from a reed ally daniel d rappa but crushed him convincingly and went on to win election to his fifth term as us representative in the small and intimate political community of delaware important decisions are often made by a consensus of leaders from both parties so it was in when popular incumbent republican governor michael castle was forced to retire owing to term limits the result was what became known as the swap castle ran for carpers seat in the us house of representatives and carper ran for governor neither faced any significant opposition and delaware retained the services of two very popular office holders representing both major parties thus in carper was elected governor of delaware defeating the republican candidate b gary scott he ended up serving two terms as a moderate businessoriented democrat who followed two very competent and popular republican administrations those of pierre s du pont iv and castle carper chose to govern in much the same way they had over their combined years in office adding to the mix his special interest in and talent for economic development and business recruitment two particular successes were his prevention of the closure of the general motors automobile operation near newport delaware and the states victory in the competition with pennsylvania for the location of the headquarters of the pharmaceutical giant astrazeneca continuing du ponts tax cutting policies carper led an ongoing effort to reduce income tax rates eliminate the marriage penalty and estate tax cut the public utility tax and eliminate the gross receipts tax for many small businesses by doing so his administration improved the states credit rating from among the worst in the nation to an excellent aaa he also retained castles standardsbased education programs raising standards testing students and pushing through a teacher accountability bill other programs included a fully funded head start program and the creation of a prescriptiondrug benefit for seniors carpers independent new democrat approach made him popular among voters but caused grumbling among old line democrats particularly union leaders who complained that not enough of them were being awarded patronage jobs after the many years of republican control in an era of increasingly bitter partisan politics carpers actions and policies placed him at the political center in keeping with delawares consensus style of governing the most poignant event during this period was the murder of carpers personal scheduler anne marie fahey and the eventual conviction of thomas j capano for the crime capano was a wealthy wellconnected lawyer known to nearly everyone in delawares political community fahey an attractive yearold member of another wellknown family was attempting to end a romantic relationship with the married capano when he murdered her and dumped her body in the atlantic ocean us attorney colm f connolly built the case against capano who was tried and convicted then sentenced by delaware superior court judge william swain lee as a tribute to fahey who had been a youth mentor thengovernor carper also became a mentor
